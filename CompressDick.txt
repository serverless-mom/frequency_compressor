Some leaning '485' '4' spiles; '96' s'545'ed upon '4' pier-'342's; '96' '262' '118' '4' bul'869'ks of ships '83' China; '96' '530' aloft in '4' rigging, as if striving to '42' a s'773' '166' sea'869'd peep. But '182' '36' '34' l'6's'508'; of '532' '433' pent up in lath '6' p'181'er—tied to '893'ers, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How '98' is '14'? Are '4' green fields g'63'? What do '69' '43'?
But '73'! '43' '67' '117' crowds, pacing '688' '17' '4' '604', '6' '562'ingly bound '17' a dive. St'868'ge! No'124' '76' con'606't '116' '33' '4' extremest limit of '4' l'6'; loite'847' '447' '4' s'97'y lee of yonder w'36'ho'364's '76' '23' suff'972'. No. T'84' '259' '42' '22' as nigh '4' '604' as '69' '999' '51' '327' f'34'ing in. And t'43' '69' st'6'—miles of '116'—leagues. Inl'6'ers '34', '69' '67' '83' lanes '6' '34'eys, '811's '6' avenues—north, east, s'44'h, '6' west. Yet '43' '69' '34' unite. Tell me, '185' '4' magnetic virtue of '4' '107'les of '4' com'962'es of '34' '200' ships attr'735' '116' t'479''49'?
Once '117'. Say '1' '36' in '4' '893'ry; in '96' '530' l'6' of lakes. Take al'344' '138' path '1' '142', '6' '606' to '63' it '324'ries '1' d'249' in a dale, '6' '224's '1' t'43' by a pool in '4' stream. T'43' is magic in it. Let '4' '344' ab'708'-'241'ed of '508' be plunged in '90' deepest r'167'ies—st'6' '7' '128' on '90' legs, '451' '90' '908' a-'45', '6' he '76' inf'34'ibly lead '1' to '604', if '604' t'43' be in '34' '7' region. Should '1' '167' be athirst in '4' '164' Ameri'51' desert, '244' '14' experi'508't, if y'119' '324'avan '308' to be supp'596'd '31' a '559'aphysical professor. Yes, as e'131' '63' '359', meditation '6' '604' '36' wedded '17' '167'.
But '43' is an artist. He de'284'es to '684't '1' '4' '710'iest, sha'474'st, '935'est, '344' enchanting '437' of ro'128'tic l'6'scape in '34' '4' v'34'ey of '4' Saco. What is '4' chief ele'508't he employs? T'43' st'6' '90' trees, '356' '31' a hollow t'366'k, as if a '49'mit '6' a cruci'950' '85' '31'in; '6' '43' '503's '90' meadow, '6' t'43' '503' '90' cattle; '6' up '83' yonder cottage '547' a '503'y smoke. Deep '155' distant woodl'6's '768'ds a mazy '103', r'356'ing to '118'lapping spurs of mountains ba'4'd in '238' hill-'500' blue. But '463' '4' '648' '596's thus t'868'ced, '6' '463' '14' pine-tree shakes d'249' '716' sighs '46' '224's upon '14' '50'p'49'd's '342', '332' '34' '85' vain, un'759' '4' '50'p'49'd's '784' '85' '950'ed upon '4' magic stream '165' '58'. Go vi'421' '4' Pr'769'ies in June, '74' '17' scores on scores of miles '1' wade knee-deep among Tiger-li'596's—'11' is '4' '63' charm '53'ing?—Water—t'43' is '23' a '705' of '604' t'43'! Were Niagara '33' a catar'735' of s'6', '72' '1' travel y'119' thous'6' miles to '66' it? Why '64' '4' '719' poet of Tennes'66', upon suddenly receiving '149' h'6'fuls of silver, deliberate whe'4'r to '610' '58' a coat, '265' he sadly '643', or invest '90' m'63'y in a pedestrian '798' to Rock'170' B'356'? Why is al'344' e'131' robust healthy '311' '31' a robust healthy soul in '58', at '96' '75' or '173' '419' to go to sea? Why upon y'119' '171' voyage as a '962'enger, '64' '1' y'119''968' '174' '375' a mystical vibration, '74' '171' '163' '7' '1' '6' y'119' ship '85' '56' '44' of sight of l'6'? Why '64' '4' '261' Persians '330' '4' sea holy? Why '64' '4' Greeks '145' it a separate deity, '6' '249' '411' of Jove? Surely '34' '14' is '23' '327' '80'ing. And s'773' deeper '4' '80'ing of '7' '480' of Narcissus, '94' beca'364' he '87' '23' grasp '4' tor'508'ting, mild image he '282' in '4' fountain, plunged '155' it '6' '28' dr'249'ed. But '7' '276' image, we '119'selves '66' in '34' rivers '6' oceans. It is '4' image of '4' ungrasp'473' phantom of '139'; '6' '14' is '4' key to it '34'.
Now, '74' I '99' '7' I am in '4' ha'437' of '45' to sea '74''167' I begin to grow hazy '39' '4' '495', '6' begin to be '118' conscious of my lungs, I do '23' '80' to '19' it infer'796' '7' I '167' go to sea as a '962'enger. For to go as a '962'enger '1' '259' '460' '19' a purse, '6' a purse is '33' a rag un'759' '1' '19' so'559'hing in it. Be'500's, '962'engers '42' sea-'541'—grow quarrel'96'—'21' '503' of '168's—do '23' '932' '116'selves '137', as a general '124';—no, I n'167' go as a '962'enger; nor, '463' I am so'559'hing of a salt, do I '167' go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I ab'6'on '4' glory '6' distinction of '375' '493's to '200' '94' '46' '116'. For my '348', I abominate '34' hon'119''473' '952''473' toils, trials, '6' tribulations of e'131' '207' '11'so'167'. It is '538' as '137' as I '51' do to '101' '324'e of '302', '327' '409' '324'e of ships, '960'ques, brigs, scho'63'rs, '6' '11' '23'. And as '17' '45' as cook,—'463' I confess t'43' is con'500'r'473' glory in '7', a cook '213' a '563' of '493'r on ship-board—'332', '96''60', I n'167' fancied broiling fowls;—'463' '336' broiled, judiciously '33'te'796', '6' judgmatic'34'y salted '6' peppe'796', t'43' is no '63' '94' '76' '613' '117' '952''597'y, '23' to '99' r'167'enti'34'y, of a broiled fowl '169' I '76'. It is '44' of '4' idolatrous dotings of '4' '261' Egyptians upon broiled ibis '6' roasted river horse, '7' '1' '66' '4' mummies of '200' cr'545'ures in '238' huge bake-ho'364's '4' pyramids.
No, '74' I go to sea, I go as a '910' sailor, '40' '165' '4' mast, plumb d'249' '155' '4' '17'ecastle, aloft t'43' to '4' royal mast-'342'. True, '69' '743' '619' me '39' '96', '6' '106' me jump '83' spar to spar, '46' a gr'652'hopper in a May meadow. And at '171', '14' '563' of '124' is unpleasant '243'. It '678'es '63''s '587' of hon'119', '348'icularly if '1' '67' of an '261' establi'50'd '250' in '4' l'6', '4' Van Rensselaers, or R'6'olphs, or Hardi'51'utes. And '117' '169' '34', if '22' previous to '966' y'119' h'6' '155' '4' tar-pot, '1' '19' '91' lording it as a '893'ry '351'master, '380' '4' t'34'est '311's st'6' in awe of '1'. The t'868''421'ion is a keen '63', I '652'ure '1', '83' a '351'master to a sailor, '6' requires a '777' decoction of Seneca '6' '4' Stoics to en'473' '1' to grin '6' bear it. But '140' '14' '854's '141' in '75'.
What of it, if '96' '261' hunks of a sea-captain '619's me to '42' a b'267' '6' sweep d'249' '4' decks? What '185' '7' indignity amount to, weighed, I '80', in '4' scales of '4' New Testa'508't? Do '1' '54' '4' ar'397'l Gabriel '54's '138''124' '4' '759' of me, beca'364' I promptly '6' '952''597'y obey '7' '261' hunks in '7' '348'icular instance? Who '594' a slave? Tell me '7'. Well, '98', '60''167' '4' '261' sea-captains '289' '619' me '39'—'60''167' '69' '289' thump '6' punch me '39', I '19' '4' satis'418'ion of kno'768'g '7' it is '34' '40'; '7' e'131''618' '234' is '63' '103' or '173' served in '137' '4' '276' '103'—ei'4'r in a physical or '559'aphysical '378' of view, '7' is; '6' so '4' universal thump is '962'ed round, '6' '34' '524' '134' rub '356' '173''s '134'er-blades, '6' be con'606't.
Again, I '194' go to sea as a sailor, beca'364' '69' '106' a '378' of '490'ing me '17' my '461', w'43'as '69' n'167' '490' '962'engers a single penny '7' I '167' '299' of. On '4' contrary, '962'engers '116'selves '259' '490'. And t'43' is '34' '4' difference in '4' '296' '592'ween '490'ing '6' '213' paid. The '735' of '490'ing is '760' '4' '344' uncom'17't'473' infliction '7' '4' '149' orc'321' thieves entailed upon us. But '213' paid,—'11' '76' comp'36' '31' it? The urbane '735'ivity '31' '265' a '128' receives m'63'y is re'34'y marvellous, con'500''847' '7' we so earnestly '172' m'63'y to be '4' root of '34' '987'ly ills, '6' '7' on no ac'893' '51' a monied '128' enter heaven. Ah! '60' cheer'597'y we con'659' '119'selves to perdition!
Fin'34'y, I '194' go to sea as a sailor, beca'364' of '4' '251''96' exercise '6' pure '769' of '4' '17'e-castle deck. For as in '14' '296', '342' '768'ds '36' '458' '117' prevalent '169' '768'ds '83' astern ('7' is, if '1' n'167' vio'399' '4' Pyth'414'rean maxim), so '17' '4' '344' '348' '4' Commodore on '4' quarter-deck '42's '90' atmosp'43' at '347' h'6' '83' '4' sailors on '4' '17'ecastle. He '54's he brea'4's it '171'; '33' '23' so. In '137' '4' '276' '103' do '4' commonalty lead '238' leaders in '128'y '173' '124's, at '4' '276' '75' '7' '4' leaders '105' suspect it. But w'43''17'e it '28' '7' '180' '305' rep'545'edly smelt '4' sea as a merchant sailor, I '134' '56' '101' it '155' my '342' to go on a whaling voyage; '14' '4' invisible '476' '493'r of '4' Fates, '94' '129' '4' constant surveillance of me, '6' '669'ly '766's me, '6' influences me in '96' unac'893''473' '103'—he '51' '166' '491' '169' '138' '63' '234'. And, doubt'759', my '45' on '14' whaling voyage, '17'med '348' of '4' gr'6' programme of Providence '7' '28' drawn up a '192' '75' '414'. It '246' in as a '563' of brief interlude '6' solo '592'ween '117' ex'606'sive per'17''128'ces. I '101' it '7' '14' '348' of '4' '899' '259' '19' '366' so'559'hing '46' '14':
"Gr'6' Con'704'ed Election '17' '4' Pre'500'ncy of '4' United States. "WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. "BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."
Though I '51''23' '81' '65' it '28' '304' '7' '200' stage '128'agers, '4' Fates, '186' me d'249' '17' '14' shabby '348' of a whaling voyage, '74' '173's '85' '451' d'249' '17' magnif'972'nt '348's in '530' trage'474's, '6' '940' '6' '454' '348's in genteel '67''474's, '6' jolly '348's in '458'ces—'463' I '51''23' '81' '65' '14' '28' '304'; '332', '56' '7' I rec'34' '34' '4' circumstances, I '54' I '51' '66' a '105' '155' '4' sp'847's '6' motives '265' '213' cunningly '986'ed to me '447' various disguises, induced me to '451' '39' per'17'ming '4' '348' I '64', be'500's cajoling me '155' '4' delusion '7' it '28' a '667' resulting '83' my '249' unbiased '523''76' '6' discriminating judg'508't.
Chief among '182' motives '28' '4' '118'whelming '256' of '4' '164' whale '58''968'. Such a por'606'tous '6' mysterious monster ro'364'd '34' my curio'421'y. Then '4' wild '6' distant seas w'43' he rolled '90' isl'6' bulk; '4' unde'349'r'473', '275''759' perils of '4' whale; '182', '31' '34' '4' at'606'ding marvels of a thous'6' Pat'414'nian sights '6' '602's, '148'ed to s'103' me to my '392'. With '173' '508', '760', '375' '124's '72' '23' '19' '91' induce'508'ts; '33' as '17' me, I am tor'508'ted '31' an '167''181'ing itch '17' '124's remote.

Not igno'847' '11' is '68', I am quick to perceive a horror, '6' '87' s'773' be social '31' it—'72' '69' '123' me—'317' it is '33' '35' to be on fri'398'ly terms '31' '34' '4' inmates of '4' '226' '63' lodges in.

CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.

I '343'ed a shirt or '149' '155' my '261' '324'pet-bag, tucked it '447' my arm, '6' '319'ed '17' Cape Horn '6' '4' Pacific. Quitting '4' '68' '709' of '261' Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bed'17'd. It '28' a Satur'183' '168' in December. Much '28' I disap'378'ed upon '819'ing '7' '4' '105' packet '17' Nantucket '97' '287' sailed, '6' '7' no '103' of r'356'ing '7' '226' '72' '141'er, '773' '4' '858'ing Mon'183'.
As '344' '507' '51''64'ates '17' '4' '684's '6' penalties of whaling '188' at '14' '276' New Bed'17'd, '98'ce to em'960'k on '238' voyage, it '289' as '35' be re'399'd '7' I, '17' '63', '97' no '256' of so '143'. For my '241' '28' '721'e up to sail in no '173' '169' a Nantucket craft, beca'364' t'43' '28' a '178', boisterous so'559'hing '39' e'131''124' connected '31' '7' famous '261' isl'6', '265' '738'ly '142'd me. Be'500's '463' New Bed'17'd '129' of '399' '91' gradu'34'y monopolising '4' '355' of whaling, '6' '463' in '14' '301' '719' '261' Nantucket is '56' '137' '528' '49', '332' Nantucket '28' '49' '164' original—'4' Tyre of '14' Carthage;—'4' '226' w'43' '4' '171' '314' Ameri'51' whale '28' str'6'ed. W'43' '234' '33' '83' Nantucket '64' '200' aboriginal whale'508', '4' Red-Men, '171' s'34'y '44' in '51'oes to '145' c'129'e to '4' Levia'169'? And w'43' '33' '83' Nantucket, '111', '64' '7' '171' adventurous '105' sloop '186' '17'th, '348'ly laden '31' imported cobblest'913'—so '547' '4' '480'—to '687' at '4' whales, in '619' to disc'118' '74' '69' '85' nigh '243' to risk a harpoon '83' '4' bowsprit?
Now '305' a '168', a '183', '6' s'773' an'173' '168' '858'ing '165' me in New Bed'17'd, ere I '87' em'960'k '17' my destined port, it be'246' a '301' of c'336'rn'508't w'43' I '28' to '545' '6' '503' '80''313'. It '28' a '131' dubious-'262', nay, a '131' '967' '6' dismal '168', '437'ingly '690' '6' cheer'759'. I k'212' no '63' in '4' '226'. With anxious grapnels I '97' '602'ed my pocket, '6' '146' '561' up a '360' '747's of silver,—So, w'49''167' '1' go, Ishmael, '136' I to '302', as I s'111'd in '4' '845' of a dreary '811' '134'e'847' my bag, '6' compa'847' '4' gloom to'869'ds '4' north '31' '4' '967'ness to'869'ds '4' s'44'h—w'49''167' in y'119' wisdom '1' '289' conclude to lodge '17' '4' '168', my '599' Ishmael, be '115' to inquire '4' pr'972', '6' '21' be '111' '348'icular.
With halting '761's I paced '4' '811's, '6' '962'ed '4' '659' of "The Crossed Harpoons"—'33' it '720' '111' expensive '6' jolly t'43'. Fur'4'r on, '83' '4' b'40' '796' '768'dows of '4' "S'429'-Fish Inn," t'43' '246' '375' fervent rays, '7' it '562'ed to '19' melted '4' packed s'56' '6' '972' '83' '165' '4' ho'364', '17' e'131'w'43' '234' '4' congealed frost lay '606' inches thick in a '321', asphaltic pave'508't,—'743' '854'y '17' me, '74' I struck my foot '485' '4' flinty projections, beca'364' '83' '321', remorse'759' serv'972' '4' soles of my boots '85' in a '344' miser'473' p'703'. Too expensive '6' jolly, '158' '147' I, pa'970' '63' mo'508't to '430' '4' b'937' gl'36' in '4' '811', '6' '230' '4' '602's of '4' tinkling gl'652'es '31'in. But go on, Ishmael, '136' I at '181'; '21' '1' '230'? '42' '170' '83' '165' '4' '450'; y'119' patched boots '36' '188'ping '4' '103'. So on I '277'. I '56' by instinct '858'ed '4' '811's '7' '111'k me '604''869'd, '17' t'43', doubt'759', '85' '4' cheapest, if '23' '4' cheeriest inns.
Such dreary '811's! blocks of '751'ness, '23' ho'364's, on ei'4'r h'6', '6' '43' '6' t'43' a '51'dle, '46' a '51'dle '772' '39' in a tomb. At '14' '612' of '4' '168', of '4' '181' '183' of '4' '532', '7' quarter of '4' t'249' '831'd '34' '33' deserted. But '986'ly I '246' to a smoky '703' proceeding '83' a low, wide '912', '4' '450' of '265' s'111'd invitingly '422'. It '97' a '324'e'759' '73', as if it '85' '588' '17' '4' '364's of '4' public; so, ente'847', '4' '171' '124' I '64' '28' to stumble '118' an ash-'990' in '4' porch. Ha! '147' I, ha, as '4' f'666' '348'icles al'344' choked me, '36' '182' a'50's '83' '7' destroyed '709', Gomorrah? But "The Crossed Harpoons," '6' "The S'429'-Fish?"—'14', '98' '259' '460' be '4' '659' of "The Trap." How'167', I '512'ed '302' up '6' hea'847' a loud '915' '31'in, pu'50'd on '6' '422'ed a '347', interior '450'.
It '562'ed '4' '164' Black Parlia'508't '812' in Tophet. A hund'796' '751' '352's '391'ed round in '238' rows to peer; '6' beyond, a '751' '866' of Doom '28' '942'ing a '560' in a pulpit. It '28' a negro church; '6' '4' pr'356'er's text '28' '39' '4' '751'ness of '967'ness, '6' '4' weeping '6' wailing '6' teeth-gnashing t'43'. Ha, Ishmael, mutte'796' I, '78'ing '44', Wretched entertain'508't at '4' '659' of 'The Trap!'
Moving on, I at '181' '246' to a dim '563' of '703' '23' '458' '83' '4' docks, '6' '299' a '17'lorn creaking in '4' '769'; '6' '262' up, '282' a s'768'ging '659' '118' '4' '450' '31' a '691' '684'ting upon it, faintly re'986'ing a t'34' '688' jet of misty spray, '6' '182' '429's '447'n'545'h—"The Sp'44'er Inn:—Peter C'141'in."
C'141'in?—Sp'44'er?—Ra'4'r ominous in '7' '348'icular connexion, '147' I. But it is a common '275' in Nantucket, '69' '99', '6' I '803' '14' Peter '43' is an emig'868't '83' t'43'. As '4' '703' '720' so dim, '6' '4' '226', '17' '4' '75', '720' '935' '243', '6' '4' dilapi'517'd '105' wooden ho'364' '716'elf '720' as if it '240' '19' '91' '324'ted '43' '83' '4' ruins of '96' burnt district, '6' as '4' s'768'ging '659' '97' a p'118'ty-stricken '563' of creak to it, I '147' '7' '43' '28' '4' '131' spot '17' cheap lodgings, '6' '4' '258' of pea c'141'ee.
It '28' a queer '563' of '226'—a g'473'-'398'ed '261' ho'364', '63' '500' palsied as it '85', '6' leaning '118' sadly. It s'111'd on a sharp bleak corner, w'43' '7' tempestuous '768'd Euroclydon '764' up a '623' '60'ling '169' '167' it '64' '39' '719' '586''s tossed craft. Euroclydon, n'167''4''759', is a '240'y pleasant zephyr to '138' '63' in-'450's, '31' '90' '908' on '4' hob '935'ly toasting '17' '515'. "In judging of '7' tempestuous '768'd c'34'ed Euroclydon," '415' an '261' '863'r—of '94'se '176's I possess '4' '146' copy extant—"it '106'th a marvellous difference, whe'4'r thou '73'est '44' at it '83' a gl'652' '768'dow w'43' '4' frost is '34' on '4' '44''500', or whe'4'r thou observest it '83' '7' sash'759' '768'dow, w'43' '4' frost is on '312' '500's, '6' of '265' '4' wight D'545'h is '4' '146' glazier."

The universe is '914'ed; '4' copest'63' is on, '6' '4' chips '85' '324'ted '141' a '827' '266' '414'. Poor Lazarus t'43', chatte'847' '90' teeth '485' '4' curbst'63' '17' '90' pillow, '6' shaking '141' '90' tatters '31' '90' shive'847's, he '240' plug up '312' ears '31' rags, '6' '186' a corn-cob '155' '90' '843', '6' '332' '7' '72' '23' '184' '44' '4' tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! '415' '261' Dives, in '90' '796' silken wrapper—(he '97' a '796'der '63' '180''869'ds) p'626', p'626'! What a '178' frosty '168'; '60' Orion glitters; '11' nor'4'rn '703's!

But '11' '54's Lazarus? Can he '869'm '90' blue '524' by '956' '116' up to '4' gr'6' nor'4'rn '703's? Would '23' Lazarus '743' be in Sumatra '169' '43'?

Now, '7' Lazarus '134' '596' str'6'ed t'43' on '4' curbst'63' '165' '4' '450' of Dives, '14' is '117' '533' '169' '7' an '972'berg '134' be moo'796' to '63' of '4' Moluccas.

But no '117' of '14' blubbe'847' '56', we '36' '45' a-whaling, '6' t'43' is plenty of '7' '332' to '67'. Let us scrape '4' '972' '83' '119' frosted '908', '6' '66' '11' '563' of a '226' '14' "Sp'44'er" '289' be.




CHAPTER 3. The Sp'44'er-Inn.

Ente'847' '7' g'473'-'398'ed Sp'44'er-Inn, '1' '295' y'119''968' in a wide, low, straggling en'244' '31' '261'-fashi'63'd wainscots, re'241'ing '63' of '4' bul'869'ks of '96' condemned '261' craft. On '63' '500' hung a '131' large oil'684'ting so thoroughly besmoked, '6' e'131' '103' de'352'd, '7' in '4' unequal cross'703's by '265' '1' viewed it, it '28' '146' by diligent study '6' a series of systematic vi'421's to it, '6' '324'eful inquiry of '4' neighbors, '7' '1' '87' '138' '103' arrive at an '447'st'6'ing of '716' purpose. Such unac'893''473' m'652'es of s'97'es '6' s'97'ows, '7' at '171' '1' al'344' '147' '96' am'437'ious '507' artist, in '4' '75' of '4' New Engl'6' hags, '97' '398'eavo'796' to de'518'ate chaos bewitched. But by dint of '137' '6' earnest contemplation, '6' oft rep'545'ed ponde'847's, '6' especi'34'y by thro'768'g '422' '4' '105' '768'dow to'869'ds '4' '78' of '4' en'244', '1' at '181' '67' to '4' conclusion '7' '375' an '256', '60''167' wild, '240' '23' be alto'42''49' un'869''868'ted.
But '11' '344' puzzled '6' con'295'ed '1' '28' a '192', limber, por'606'tous, '751' m'652' of so'559'hing h'118'ing in '4' centre of '4' '648' '118' '291' blue, dim, perp'398'icular '518's floating in a '275''759' yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy '648' truly, '243' to '698' a nervous '128' distr'735'ed. Yet '28' t'43' a '563' of indefinite, '499'-attained, unimagin'473' sublimity '39' it '7' '807'ly froze '1' to it, '773' '1' involuntarily '111'k an oath '31' y'119''968' to '156' '44' '11' '7' marvellous '684'ting '588'. '938'r '6' anon a b'40', '33', alas, deceptive '256' '72' dart '1' '209'.—It's '4' Black Sea in a mid'168' gale.—It's '4' unnatural combat of '4' '492' primal ele'508'ts.—It's a b'181'ed h'545'h.—It's a Hyperborean '768'ter scene.—It's '4' '448'ing-up of '4' '972'bound stream of Time. But at '181' '34' '182' fancies yielded to '7' '63' por'606'tous so'559'hing in '4' '648''s midst. That '336' '295' '44', '6' '34' '4' '426' '85' plain. But '188'; '185' it '23' bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? '140' '4' '164' levia'169' '58''968'?
In '418', '4' artist's de'659' '562'ed '14': a final '4'ory of my '249', '348'ly based upon '4' aggregated opinions of '128'y aged '369's '31' '94'm I conversed upon '4' subject. The '648' re'986's a Cape-Horner in a '164' hurri'51'e; '4' '499'-fo'447'ed ship welte'847' t'43' '31' '716' '291' dis'128'tled masts al'63' visible; '6' an exasperated whale, purposing to sp'847' '817' '118' '4' craft, is in '4' enormous '735' of impaling '58''968' upon '4' '291' mast-'342's.
The oppo'421'e w'34' of '14' en'244' '28' hung '34' '118' '31' a hea'98'ish array of monstrous '801's '6' spears. Some '85' thickly '451' '31' glitte'847' teeth resembling ivory '282's; '173's '85' tufted '31' k'23's of hu'128' h'769'; '6' '63' '28' '541'le-shaped, '31' a vast '627' sweeping round '46' '4' seg'508't '721'e in '4' '212'-m'249' gr'652' by a '192'-armed m'969'r.

Mixed '31' '182' '85' rusty '261' whaling lances '6' harpoons '34' '785'n '6' de'17'med. Some '85' storied weapons. With '14' '336' '192' lance, '56' wildly elb'969'd, fifty '266' '414' '64' Na'169' Swain '320' fifteen whales '592'ween a sunrise '6' a sun'451'. And '7' harpoon—so '46' a corkscrew '56'—'28' flung in Javan seas, '6' '366' '170' '31' by a whale, '266' '180''869'ds slain '141' '4' Cape of Blanco. The original iron ente'796' nigh '4' tail, '6', '46' a '426''759' '107'le soj'119'ning in '4' '618' of a '128', travelled '597' '17'ty '908', '6' at '181' '28' '295' im'515'ded in '4' hump.
Crossing '14' dusky en'244', '6' on '209' yon low-arched '103'—'537' '209' '11' in '261' '464' '259' '19' '91' a '164' central c'58'ney '31' '522''226's '34' round—'1' enter '4' public '267'. A s'773' duskier '226' is '14', '31' '375' low ponderous beams above, '6' '375' '261' wrinkled '519'ks ben'545'h, '7' '1' '72' al'344' fancy '1' trod '96' '261' craft's cockp'716', especi'34'y of '375' a '60'ling '168', '74' '14' corner-ancho'796' '261' ark rocked so furiously. On '63' '500' s'111'd a '192', low, '50'lf-'46' t'473' c'118'ed '31' cracked gl'652' '390's, filled '31' dusty rarities gat'43'd '83' '14' wide '296''s remo'704' nooks. Projecting '83' '4' fur'4'r angle of '4' '267' st'6's a '967'-'262' den—'4' '960'—a rude attempt at a '40' whale's '342'. Be '7' '60' it '289', t'43' st'6's '4' vast arched b'63' of '4' whale's jaw, so wide, a coach '240' al'344' '698' ben'545'h it. Within '36' shabby '50'lves, '868'ged round '31' '261' de'51'ters, bottles, fl'257's; '6' in '200' jaws of swift destruction, '46' an'173' cursed Jonah (by '265' '275' indeed '69' c'34'ed '58'), bustles a '105' wit'43'd '261' '128', '94', '17' '238' m'63'y, d'865' sells '4' sailors deliriums '6' '548'.

Fill to '14' mark, '6' y'119' charge is '33' a penny; to '14' a penny '117'; '6' so on to '4' '597' gl'652'—'4' Cape Horn mea'115', '265' '1' '289' gulp d'249' '17' a shilling.
Upon ente'847' '4' '226' I '295' a '539' of '507' sea'508' gat'43'd '39' a t'473', examining by a dim '703' divers speci'508's of skrimsh'6'er. I sought '4' l'6'lord, '6' '361' '58' I de'284'ed to be accommo'517'd '31' a '267', received '17' '491' '7' '90' ho'364' '28' '597'—'23' a '515' unoccupied. "But avast," he added, tapping '90' '17'e'342', "'1' haint no objections to sha'847' a harpo'63'er's blanket, '19' ye? I s'pose '1' '36' goin' a-whalin', so '322' '166' '42' '364'd to '7' '563' of '124'."

"I '147' so. All '40'; '101' a s'545'. Supper?—'1' '53' supper? Supper'll be '325' directly."
I sat d'249' on an '261' wooden '451'tle, '324'ved '34' '118' '46' a bench on '4' Battery. At '63' '398' a ruminating tar '28' s'773' fur'4'r adorning it '31' '90' jack-knife, s'111'ping '118' '6' diligently '406' '170' at '4' space '592'ween '90' legs.

At '181' '96' '492' or '401' of us '85' summ'63'd to '119' meal in an adjoining '267'. It '28' '690' as Icel'6'—no '522' at '34'—'4' l'6'lord '136' he '87'n't af'17'd it. No'124' '33' '149' dismal t'34'ow '51'dles, '356' in a '768'ding '50'et. We '85' fain to '33'ton up '119' monkey jackets, '6' '330' to '119' lips cups of scalding tea '31' '119' '499' frozen fingers. But '4' f'36' '28' of '4' '344' substantial '207'—'23' '146' m'545' '6' potatoes, '33' dumplings; '68' heavens! dumplings '17' supper! One '507' '947'ow in a green '990' coat, ad'926'ed '58''968' to '182' dumplings in a '344' direful '128'ner.
"My '311'," '136' '4' l'6'lord, "'248' '19' '4' '168'm'36' to a '314' sartainty."
"L'6'lord," I w'90'pe'796', "'7' aint '4' harpo'63'er is it?"
"Oh, no," '136' he, '262' a '563' of diabolic'34'y '427'ny, "'4' harpo'63'er is a '967' complexi'63'd chap. He n'167' '545's dumplings, he '21'—he '545's no'124' '33' steaks, '6' he '46's '514' r'36'."
"The d'779' he '185'," '415' I. "W'43' is '7' harpo'63'er? Is he '43'?"
"He'll be '43' a'17'e '192'," '28' '4' '491'.
I '87' '23' '148' it, '33' I began to '174' suspicious of '14' "'967' complexi'63'd" harpo'63'er. At '138' rate, I '721'e up my '241' '7' if it so '391'ed '44' '7' we '134' '503' to'42''49', he '259' un'926' '6' '42' '155' '515' '165' I '64'.
Supper '118', '4' '624' '277' '78' to '4' '960'-'267', '74', kno'768'g '23' '11' '234' to do '31' '302', I resolved to sp'398' '4' '426' of '4' '140'ing as a '73'er on.
Pre'708'ly a rioting noise '28' '299' '327'. Starting up, '4' l'6'lord cried, "That's '4' Grampus's crew. I '66'd '49' reported in '4' '141'ing '14' '339'; a '291' '266'' voyage, '6' a '597' ship. Hurrah, '311's; '56' '221' '19' '4' '399'st '212's '83' '4' Feegees."
A tramping of sea boots '28' '299' in '4' en'244'; '4' '450' '28' flung '422', '6' in rolled a wild '451' of mariners '243'. Enveloped in '238' shaggy '430' coats, '6' '31' '238' '342's muffled in woollen com'17'ters, '34' '515'arned '6' ragged, '6' '238' beards stiff '31' icicles, '69' '562'ed an eruption of bears '83' Labrador. T'84' '97' '22' l'6'ed '83' '238' boat, '6' '14' '28' '4' '171' ho'364' '69' ente'796'. No '683', '98', '7' '69' '721'e a '688' '830' '17' '4' whale's '843'—'4' '960'—'74' '4' wrinkled '105' '261' Jonah, t'43' '141'iciating, '358' p'119'ed '116' '44' brimmers '34' round. One complained of a '217' '690' in '90' '342', upon '265' Jonah mixed '58' a pitch-'46' potion of gin '6' mol'652'es, '265' he swore '28' a s'118'eign cure '17' '34' '690's '6' catarrhs '11'so'167', n'167' '241' of '60' '192' st'6'ing, or whe'4'r '808' '141' '4' coast of Labrador, or on '4' wea'4'r '500' of an '972'-isl'6'.
The liquor '358' mounted '155' '238' '342's, as it gener'34'y '185' '140' '31' '4' ar'868''704' '739'ers '212'ly l'6'ed '83' sea, '6' '69' began cape'847' '39' '344' obstreperously.
I observed, '60''167', '7' '63' of '116' held '96''11' aloof, '6' '463' he '562'ed de'284'ous '23' to spoil '4' hilarity of '90' shipmates by '90' '249' sober '352', '332' upon '4' '251' he refrained '83' '380' as '137' noise as '4' '426'. T'90' '128' inte'426'ed me at '336'; '6' '317' '4' sea-'152's '97' ordained '7' he '134' '358' be'67' my shipmate ('463' '33' a '503'ing-'348'ner '63', so '458' as '14' narrative is '936'), I '76' '43' venture upon a '105' description of '58'. He s'111'd '597' '578' '908' in h'879', '31' noble '134'ers, '6' a chest '46' a c'141'er-dam. I '19' seldom '333' '375' brawn in a '128'. His '352' '28' deeply br'249' '6' burnt, '380' '90' '691' teeth dazzling by '4' contrast; '313' in '4' deep s'97'ows of '90' '495' floated '96' reminiscences '7' '64' '23' '562' to '145' '58' '137' joy. His '915' at '336' announced '7' he '28' a Sou'4'rner, '6' '83' '90' '178' stature, I '147' he '259' be '63' of '200' t'34' mountaineers '83' '4' Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When '4' revelry of '90' companions '97' mounted to '716' h'879', '14' '128' slipped '170' unobserved, '6' I '282' no '117' of '58' '773' he be'246' my comrade on '4' sea. In a '360' '294's, '60''167', he '28' '786' by '90' shipmates, '6' '213', it '562's, '17' '96' '385' a huge fav'119'ite '31' '116', '69' raised a cry of "Bulkington! Bulkington! w'43''s Bulkington?" '6' darted '44' of '4' ho'364' in pursuit of '58'.
It '28' '56' '39' nine o'clock, '6' '4' '267' '562'ing al'344' supernatur'34'y '935' '180' '182' orgies, I began to congratu'399' '302' upon a '105' '519' '7' '97' occur'796' to me '22' previous to '4' ent'868'ce of '4' sea'508'.
No '128' prefers to '503' '149' in a '515'. In '418', '1' '72' a '68' '334' '743' '23' '503' '31' y'119' '249' '411'. I '21' k'56' '60' it is, '33' '151' '46' to be '988' '74' '69' '36' '503'ing. And '74' it '67's to '503'ing '31' an un'677' st'868'ger, in a st'868'ge inn, in a st'868'ge t'249', '6' '7' st'868'ger a harpo'63'er, '98' y'119' objections in'780' multiply. Nor '28' t'43' '138' '987'ly '385' '65' I as a sailor '134' '503' '149' in a '515', '117' '169' '138''618' '234'; '17' sailors no '117' '503' '149' in a '515' at sea, '169' bachelor Kings do ashore. To be '115' '69' '34' '503' to'42''49' in '63' '814', '33' '1' '19' y'119' '249' hammock, '6' c'118' y'119''968' '31' y'119' '249' blanket, '6' '503' in y'119' '249' skin.
The '117' I ponde'796' '118' '14' harpo'63'er, '4' '117' I abominated '4' '147' of '503'ing '31' '58'. It '28' '807' to presume '7' '213' a harpo'63'er, '90' '518'n or woollen, as '4' '390' '240' be, '72' '23' be of '4' ti'474'st, '658' '697' of '4' '178'st. I began to twitch '34' '118'. Be'500's, it '28' '42'ting '399', '6' my decent harpo'63'er ought to be '179' '6' '45' '515''869'ds. Suppose '56', he '134' tumble in upon me at mid'168'—'60' '87' I '81' '83' '11' vile hole he '97' '91' '260'?
"L'6'lord! '114' '397'd my '241' '39' '7' harpo'63'er.—I shan't '503' '31' '58'. '82' '244' '4' bench '43'."
"Just as '1' '142'; '16' '120' I '51't sp'36' ye a t'473'c'202'h '17' a mattress, '6' '30' a pla'191' rough board '43'"—'174'ing of '4' k'23's '6' '23'ches. "But '154' a '437', Skrimsh'6'er; '114' '61' a '324'penter's '519'e t'43' in '4' '960'—'154', I '99', '6' '82' '106' ye snug '243'." So '99'ing he procu'796' '4' '519'e; '6' '31' '90' '261' silk h'6'kerchief '171' dusting '4' bench, vigorously '451' to '519'ing '170' at my '515', '4' '313' grinning '46' an ape. The s'305's flew '40' '6' '269'; '773' at '181' '4' '519'e-iron '246' bump '485' an indestructible k'23'. The l'6'lord '28' '958' spraining '90' wrist, '6' I '163' '58' '17' heaven's '997' to quit—'4' '515' '28' soft '243' to suit me, '6' I '64' '23' k'56' '60' '34' '4' '519'ing in '4' '296' '87' '106' eider d'249' of a pine '519'k. So ga'4''847' up '4' s'305's '31' an'173' grin, '6' thro'768'g '116' '155' '4' '164' stove in '4' '845' of '4' '267', he '277' '39' '90' '355', '6' '269' me in a br'249' study.
I '56' '111'k '4' mea'115' of '4' bench, '6' '295' '7' it '28' a foot '111' '940'; '33' '7' '87' be '508'ded '31' a ch'769'. But it '28' a foot '111' narrow, '6' '4' '173' bench in '4' '267' '28' '39' '492' inches '530'er '169' '4' '519'ed '63'—so t'43' '28' no yoking '116'. I '98' '226'd '4' '171' bench lengthwise '549' '4' '146' '574' space '485' '4' w'34', '568' a '105' interval '592'ween, '17' my '78' to '451'tle d'249' in. But I '358' '295' '7' t'43' '246' '375' a draught of '690' '769' '118' me '83' '447' '4' sill of '4' '768'dow, '7' '14' '519' '72' n'167' do at '34', especi'34'y as an'173' current '83' '4' rickety '450' '559' '4' '63' '83' '4' '768'dow, '6' '312' to'42''49' '17'med a series of sm'34' whirl'768'ds in '4' immediate vicinity of '4' spot w'43' I '97' '147' to sp'398' '4' '168'.
The d'779' fetch '7' harpo'63'er, '147' I, '33' '188', '87'n't I steal a march on '58'—bolt '90' '450' in'500', '6' jump '155' '90' '515', '23' to be '830'ned by '4' '344' violent knockings? It '562'ed no '217' '256'; '33' upon '347' '147's I dis'786' it. For '94' '87' '81' '33' '11' '4' '290' '339', so '358' as I popped '44' of '4' '267', '4' harpo'63'er '240' be st'6'ing in '4' en'244', '34' '325' to knock me d'249'!
S'773', '262' round me '158', '6' '66'ing no '622' '365' of sp'398'ing a suffer'473' '168' un'759' in '96' '173' '369''s '515', I began to '54' '7' '180' '34' I '240' be c'49'ishing un'869''868't'473' prejud'972's '485' '14' un'677' harpo'63'er. Thinks I, '82' '154' a'313'; he '259' be '705'ping in '165' '192'. '82' '19' a '68' '73' at '58' '98', '6' '760' we '289' be'67' jolly '68' '515''947'ows '180' '34'—t'43''s no '361'.
But '463' '4' '173' boarders '764' '260' in by '913', '149's, '6' '291's, '6' '45' to '515', '332' no '659' of my harpo'63'er.
"L'6'lord!" '136' I, "'11' '563' of a chap is he—'185' he '194' '184' '375' '399' '520'?" It '28' '56' '321' upon twelve o'clock.
The l'6'lord chuckled '158' '31' '90' lean chuckle, '6' '562'ed to be '240'ily tickled at so'559'hing beyond my comprehension. "No," he '491'ed, "gener'34'y '86' an '865' bird—'769'ley to '515' '6' '769'ley to rise—'89', '86' '4' bird '11' '756'es '4' worm. But to-'168' he '277' '44' a peddling, '1' '66', '6' I '21' '66' '11' on '769'th '184's '58' so '399', un'759', '289' be, he '51''t sell '90' '342'."
"Can't sell '90' '342'?—What '563' of a bamboozingly '480' is '14' '1' '36' '361' me?" '42'ting '155' a t'969''847' rage. "Do '1' pre'606'd to '99', l'6'lord, '7' '14' harpo'63'er is '735'u'34'y engaged '14' b'759'ed Satur'183' '168', or '743' Sun'183' '339', in peddling '90' '342' '187' '14' t'249'?"
"That's precisely it," '136' '4' l'6'lord, "'6' I '163' '58' he '87'n't sell it '43', '4' market's '118'stocked."
"With '11'?" sh'44'ed I.
"With '342's to be '115'; '594' t'43' '111' '128'y '342's in '4' '296'?"
"I '81' '1' '11' it is, l'6'lord," '136' I '538' '804'ly, "'322' '166' '188' spinning '7' yarn to me—'16' '23' green."
"May be '23'," '409' '44' a '856' '6' w'479'tling a '111'th'512', "'33' I ray'4'r '214' '248' be d'63' br'249' if '7' ere harpo'63'er '230's '1' a sl'6'erin' '90' '342'."
"'82' '448' it '17' '58'," '136' I, '56' f'666' '155' a '962'ion '158' at '14' unac'893''473' '458'r'414' of '4' l'6'lord's.
"It's '785' a''325'," '136' he.
"Broke," '136' I—"'785', do '1' '80'?"
"Sartain, '6' '55' '4' '131' '385' he '51''t sell it, I '214'."
"L'6'lord," '136' I, '45' up to '58' as '494' as Mt. Hecla in a s'56'-storm—"l'6'lord, '188' w'479'tling. You '6' I '259' '447'st'6' '63' an'173', '6' '7' '111' '327' delay.

"W'34'," '136' '4' l'6'lord, fetching a '192' br'545'h, "'55' a purty '192' sarmon '17' a chap '7' rips a '105' '56' '6' '98'.

T'90' ac'893' clea'796' up '4' '173'wise unac'893''473' mystery, '6' s'60'ed '7' '4' l'6'lord, '180' '34', '97' '97' no '256' of fooling me—'33' at '4' '276' '75' '11' '87' I '54' of a harpo'63'er '94' '235'ed '44' of a Satur'183' '168' '817' '155' '4' holy Sabbath, engaged in '375' a '51'nibal '355' as selling '4' '342's of '314' idolators?
"Dep'398' upon it, l'6'lord, '7' harpo'63'er is a dangerous '128'."
"He '490's reg'lar," '28' '4' rejoinder. "But '67', '30' '42'ting d'504'ful '399', '1' '97' '166' be '391'ing flukes—'30' a n'972' '515'; Sal '6' me slept in '7' ere '515' '4' '168' we '85' spl'972'd.

But I s'111'd irresolute; '74' '262' at a clock in '4' corner, he exclaimed "I vum '30' Sun'183'—'1' '205' '66' '7' harpo'63'er to-'168'; '86' '67' to anchor '96'w'43'—'67' '549' '98'; do '67'; '205' ye '67'?"

"T'43'," '136' '4' l'6'lord, placing '4' '51'dle on a '419' '261' sea chest '7' '64' double duty as a '28'h-st'6' '6' centre t'473'; "t'43', '106' y'119''968' com'17't'473' '56', '6' '68' '168' to ye." I '391'ed round '83' '784'ing '4' '515', '33' he '97' disappea'796'.
F'261'ing '78' '4' '893'erpane, I s'111'ped '118' '4' '515'. Though '697' of '4' '344' elegant, it '332' s'111'd '4' scrutiny tolerably '35'. I '98' glanced round '4' '267'; '6' be'500's '4' '515'stead '6' centre t'473', '87' '66' no '173' furniture be'192'ing to '4' '226', '33' a rude '50'lf, '4' '492' w'34's, '6' a '888'ed '522'board re'986'ing a '128' striking a whale. Of '124's '23' properly be'192'ing to '4' '267', t'43' '28' a hammock la'50'd up, '6' '687'n upon '4' '983' in '63' corner; '516' a large sea'128''s bag, containing '4' harpo'63'er's '869'drobe, no doubt in '596'u of a l'6' t'366'k. Likewise, t'43' '28' a parcel of '44'l'6'ish b'63' fish hooks on '4' '50'lf '118' '4' '522'-'226', '6' a t'34' harpoon st'6'ing at '4' '342' of '4' '515'.
But '11' is '14' on '4' chest? I '111'k it up, '6' held it '452' to '4' '703', '6' '577' it, '6' smelt it, '6' '457' e'131' '103' '622' to arrive at '96' satis'418'ory conclusion c'336'rning it. I '51' comp'36' it to no'124' '33' a large '450' mat, orna'508'ted at '4' edges '31' '105' tinkling tags so'559'hing '46' '4' stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. T'43' '28' a hole or slit in '4' '845' of '14' mat, as '1' '66' '4' '276' in S'44'h Ameri'51' ponchos. But '87' it be '622' '7' '138' sober harpo'63'er '72' '42' '155' a '450' mat, '6' parade '4' '811's of '138' '917'tian t'249' in '7' '563' of guise? I '186' it on, to '244' it, '6' it weighed me d'249' '46' a hamper, '213' uncomm'146' shaggy '6' thick, '6' I '147' a '105' damp, as '463' '14' mysterious harpo'63'er '97' '91' wea'847' it of a rainy '183'. I '277' up in it to a '437' of gl'652' stuck '485' '4' w'34', '6' I n'167' '282' '375' a sight in my '139'. I tore '302' '44' of it in '375' a '906' '7' I '417' '302' a kink in '4' neck.
I sat d'249' on '4' '500' of '4' '515', '6' com'508'ced '54'ing '39' '14' '342'-peddling harpo'63'er, '6' '90' '450' mat. After '54'ing '96' '75' on '4' '515'-'500', I '61' up '6' '111'k '141' my monkey jacket, '6' '98' s'111'd in '4' '845' of '4' '267' '54'ing. I '98' '111'k '141' my coat, '6' '147' a '105' '117' in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to '174' '131' '690' '56', '499' un'926'ed as I '28', '6' '219'ing '11' '4' l'6'lord '136' '39' '4' harpo'63'er's '23' '260' '179' at '34' '7' '168', it '213' so '131' '399', I '721'e no '117' ado, '33' jumped '44' of my pantaloons '6' boots, '6' '98' blo'768'g '44' '4' '703' tumbled '155' '515', '6' com'508'ded '302' to '4' '324'e of heaven.
Whe'4'r '7' mattress '28' '343'ed '31' corn-cobs or '785'n crockery, t'43' is no '361', '33' I rolled '39' a '68' '334', '6' '87' '23' '503' '17' a '192' '75'. At '181' I slid '141' '155' a '703' doze, '6' '97' '281' '958'ly '721'e a '68' '141'ing to'869'ds '4' l'6' of Nod, '74' I '299' a heavy footf'34' in '4' '962'age, '6' '282' a glimmer of '703' '67' '155' '4' '267' '83' '447' '4' '450'.
Lord '550' me, '54's I, '7' '259' be '4' harpo'63'er, '4' infernal '342'-peddler. But I lay '475'ly s'773', '6' resolved '23' to '99' a '429' '773' spoken to. H'261'ing a '703' in '63' h'6', '6' '7' identical New Zeal'6' '342' in '4' '173', '4' st'868'ger ente'796' '4' '267', '6' '327' '262' to'869'ds '4' '515', '226'd '90' '51'dle a '68' '103' '141' '83' me on '4' '983' in '63' corner, '6' '98' began '406' '170' at '4' k'23'ted cords of '4' large bag I '165' spoke of as '213' in '4' '267'. I '28' '34' eagerness to '66' '90' '352', '33' he '764' it averted '17' '96' '75' '313' employed in unlacing '4' bag's '843'. T'90' accompli'50'd, '60''167', he '391'ed round—'74', '68' heavens! '11' a sight! Such a '352'! It '28' of a '967', purplish, yellow col'119', '43' '6' t'43' stuck '118' '31' large '751'ish '262' squ'36's. Yes, '30' '22' as I '147', '86' a '816' '515''947'ow; '86' '91' in a '535', '61' d'504''597'y '537', '6' '43' he is, '22' '83' '4' surgeon. But at '7' mo'508't he '365'd to '391' '90' '352' so to'869'ds '4' '703', '7' I plainly '282' '69' '87' '23' be '856'ing-p'181'ers at '34', '200' '751' squ'36's on '90' cheeks. T'84' '85' stains of '96' '563' or '173'. At '171' I k'212' '23' '11' to '106' of '14'; '33' '358' an inkling of '4' '350' occur'796' to me. I '219'ed a '480' of a '691' '128'—a whale'128' '111'—'94', f'34'ing among '4' '51'nibals, '97' '91' tat'111'ed by '116'. I concluded '7' '14' harpo'63'er, in '4' '239' of '90' distant voyages, '259' '19' '559' '31' a similar adventure. And '11' is it, '147' I, '180' '34'! It's '146' '90' '44''500'; a '128' '51' be h'913't in '138' '563' of skin. But '98', '11' to '106' of '90' un'987'ly complexion, '7' '348' of it, I '80', '666' round '39', '6' comp'123'ely indep'398'ent of '4' squ'36's of tat'111'ing. To be '115', it '240' be no'124' '33' a '68' coat of tropical tanning; '33' I n'167' '299' of a '576' sun's tanning a '691' '128' '155' a purplish yellow '63'. How'167', I '97' n'167' '91' in '4' S'44'h Seas; '6' '760' '4' sun t'43' produced '182' extraordinary effects upon '4' skin. Now, '313' '34' '182' '256's '85' '962'ing '209' me '46' '703'ning, '14' harpo'63'er n'167' '23''972'd me at '34'. But, '180' '96' difficulty '305' '422'ed '90' bag, he com'508'ced fumbling in it, '6' '986'ly '732'ed '44' a '563' of tomahawk, '6' a seal-skin w'34'et '31' '4' h'769' on. Placing '182' on '4' '261' chest in '4' '845' of '4' '267', he '98' '111'k '4' New Zeal'6' '342'—a g'129'tly '124' '243'—'6' crammed it d'249' '155' '4' bag. He '56' '111'k '141' '90' hat—a '212' beaver hat—'74' I '246' nigh singing '44' '31' fresh '715'. T'43' '28' no h'769' on '90' '342'—'697' to '613' of at '402'—no'124' '33' a sm'34' scalp-k'23' twisted up on '90' '17'e'342'. His bald purplish '342' '56' '720' '17' '34' '4' '296' '46' a mildewed skull. Had '23' '4' st'868'ger s'111'd '592'ween me '6' '4' '450', I '72' '19' bolted '44' of it quicker '169' '167' I bolted a '484'.
'938'n as it '28', I '147' so'559'hing of slipping '44' of '4' '768'dow, '33' it '28' '4' '347' '983' '78'. I am no co'869'd, '33' '11' to '106' of '14' '342'-peddling purple rascal alto'42''49' '962'ed my comprehension. Igno'868'ce is '4' p'36'nt of fear, '6' '213' comp'123'ely nonplussed '6' con'295'ed '39' '4' st'868'ger, I confess I '28' '56' as '137' '423' of '58' as if it '28' '4' d'779' '58''968' '94' '97' thus '785'n '155' my '267' at '4' '314' of '168'. In '418', I '28' so '423' of '58' '7' I '28' '23' '544' '243' '22' '98' to ad'926' '58', '6' de'128'd a satis'418'ory '491' c'336'rning '11' '562'ed inexplic'473' in '58'.
Mean'313', he continued '4' '355' of un'926'ing, '6' at '181' s'60'ed '90' chest '6' arms. As I '349', '182' c'118'ed '348's of '58' '85' '396'e'796' '31' '4' '276' squ'36's as '90' '352'; '90' '78', '111', '28' '34' '118' '4' '276' '967' squ'36's; he '562'ed to '19' '91' in a Thirty Years' War, '6' '22' escaped '83' it '31' a '856'ing-p'181'er shirt. S'773' '117', '90' '131' legs '85' marked, as if a parcel of '967' green frogs '85' '573' up '4' t'366'ks of '507' palms. It '28' '56' '538' plain '7' he '259' be '96' abomin'473' savage or '173' shipped aboard of a whale'128' in '4' S'44'h Seas, '6' so l'6'ed in '14' '917'tian '893'ry. I quaked to '54' of it. A peddler of '342's '111'—'760' '4' '342's of '90' '249' '411's. He '240' '101' a fancy to '462'—heavens! '73' at '7' tomahawk!
But t'43' '28' no '75' '17' shudde'847', '17' '56' '4' savage '277' '39' so'559'hing '7' comp'123'ely fascinated my at'606'tion, '6' convinced me '7' he '259' indeed be a hea'98'. Going to '90' heavy grego, or wrap'34', or d'504'naught, '265' he '97' previously hung on a ch'769', he fumbled in '4' pockets, '6' produced at length a curious '105' de'17'med image '31' a hunch on '716' '78', '6' '304' '4' col'119' of a '291' '433'' '261' Congo '231'. Remembe'847' '4' embalmed '342', at '171' I al'344' '147' '7' '14' '751' '128'ikin '28' a '272' '231' preserved in '96' similar '128'ner. But '66'ing '7' it '28' '23' at '34' limber, '6' '7' it g'919'ened a '68' '334' '46' poli'50'd ebony, I concluded '7' it '259' be no'124' '33' a wooden idol, '265' indeed it '831'd to be. For '56' '4' savage '547' up to '4' empty '522'-'226', '6' re'772' '4' '888'ed '522'-board, '451's up '14' '105' hunch-'78'ed image, '46' a '606'pin, '592'ween '4' '6'irons. The c'58'ney jambs '6' '34' '4' bricks in'500' '85' '131' sooty, so '7' I '147' '14' '522'-'226' '721'e a '131' appropriate '105' shrine or chapel '17' '90' Congo idol.
I '56' screwed my '495' '321' to'869'ds '4' '499' hidden image, '174'ing '33' ill at ease '588'ime—to '66' '11' '28' '290' to '858'. First he '726' '39' a double h'6'ful of s'305's '44' of '90' grego pocket, '6' '226's '116' '324'e'597'y '165' '4' idol; '98' laying a '437' of ship biscuit on '739' '6' app'666' '4' flame '83' '4' lamp, he '207'led '4' s'305's '155' a sacrificial blaze. Pre'708'ly, '180' '128'y '129'ty snatches '155' '4' '522', '6' s'773' '129'tier '31'drawals of '90' fingers (w'43'by he '562'ed to be scorching '116' '217'ly), he at '181' succeeded in dra'768'g '44' '4' biscuit; '98' blo'768'g '141' '4' h'545' '6' a'50's a '105', he '721'e a polite '141'er of it to '4' '105' negro. But '4' '105' d'779' '64' '23' '562' to fancy '375' dry '563' of f'36' at '34'; he n'167' '367'd '90' lips. All '182' st'868'ge antics '85' accompanied by s'773' st'868'ger guttural noises '83' '4' devotee, '94' '562'ed to be praying in a sing-'273'g or '234' singing '96' pagan psalmody or '173', du'847' '265' '90' '352' twitched '39' in '4' '344' unnatural '128'ner. At '181' extinguishing '4' '522', he '111'k '4' idol up '131' unceremoniously, '6' bagged it '158' in '90' grego pocket as '324'e'759'ly as if he '85' a sports'128' bagging a '314' woodcock.
All '182' queer proceedings increased my uncom'17't'473'ness, '6' '66'ing '58' '56' exhi'437'ing '777' symptoms of concluding '90' '355' operations, '6' jumping '155' '515' '31' me, I '147' it '28' '530' '75', '56' or n'167', '165' '4' '703' '28' '186' '44', to '448' '4' spell in '265' I '97' so '192' '91' bound.
But '4' interval I '953' in deliberating '11' to '99', '28' a fatal '63'. Taking up '90' tomahawk '83' '4' t'473', he exa'462'd '4' '342' of it '17' an instant, '6' '98' '956' it to '4' '703', '31' '90' '843' at '4' '627', he puffed '44' '164' clouds of tobacco smoke. The '290' mo'508't '4' '703' '28' extingui'50'd, '6' '14' wild '51'nibal, tomahawk '592'ween '90' teeth, sp'868'g '155' '515' '31' me. I sang '44', I '87' '23' '148' it '56'; '6' '631' a sudden g'366't of astonish'508't he began '174'ing me.
Stamme'847' '44' so'559'hing, I k'212' '23' '11', I rolled '170' '83' '58' '485' '4' w'34', '6' '98' conju'796' '58', '94''167' or w'413'ver he '240' be, to '184' '935', '6' '123' me '42' up '6' '703' '4' lamp '158'. But '90' guttural responses satisfied me at '336' '7' he '33' ill compreh'398'ed my '80'ing.
"Who-e debel '1'?"—he at '181' '136'—"'1' no '613'-e, dam-me, I '320'-e." And so '99'ing '4' '703'ed tomahawk began fl'119'ishing '39' me in '4' '967'.
"L'6'lord, '17' God's '997', Peter C'141'in!" sh'44'ed I. "L'6'lord! Watch! C'141'in! '866's! '550' me!"
"Speak-e! '81'-ee me '94'-ee be, or dam-me, I '320'-e!" '158' growled '4' '51'nibal, '313' '90' horrid fl'119'ishings of '4' tomahawk scatte'796' '4' '576' tobacco a'50's '39' me '773' I '147' my '518'n '72' '42' on '522'. But '144' heaven, at '7' mo'508't '4' l'6'lord '246' '155' '4' '267' '703' in h'6', '6' leaping '83' '4' '515' I '868' up to '58'.
"Don't be '423' '56'," '136' he, grinning '158', "Queequeg '43' '228' harm a h'769' of y'119' '342'."
"S'739' y'119' grinning," sh'44'ed I, "'6' '65' '64'n't '1' '81' me '7' '7' infernal harpo'63'er '28' a '51'nibal?"
"I '147' ye k'56''d it;—'64'n't I '81' ye, he '28' a peddlin' '342's '187' t'249'?—'33' '391' flukes '158' '6' go to '503'. Queequeg, '73' '43'—'1' sabbee me, I sabbee—'1' '14' '128' '503'e '1'—'1' sabbee?"
"Me sabbee plenty"—g'366'ted Queequeg, puffing '170' at '90' pipe '6' '812' up in '515'.
"You '42'tee in," he added, motioning to me '31' '90' tomahawk, '6' thro'768'g '4' '945' to '63' '500'. He re'34'y '64' '14' in '23' '146' a civil '33' a re'34'y '207' '6' charit'473' '103'. I s'111'd '262' at '58' a mo'508't. For '34' '90' tat'111'ings he '28' on '4' '251' a '817', '67'ly '262' '51'nibal. What's '34' '14' fuss I '19' '91' '380' '39', '147' I to '302'—'4' '128''s a hu'128' '213' '22' as I am: he '129' '22' as '137' '385' to fear me, as I '19' to be '423' of '58'. Better '503' '31' a sober '51'nibal '169' a d'366'ken '917'tian.
"L'6'lord," '136' I, "'81' '58' to stash '90' tomahawk t'43', or pipe, or w'413'ver '1' c'34' it; '81' '58' to '188' smoking, in '940', '6' I '76' '391' in '31' '58'. But I '21' fancy '305' a '128' smoking in '515' '31' me. It's dangerous. Be'500's, I '594' insu'796'."
T'90' '213' '163' to Queequeg, he at '336' comp'596'd, '6' '158' politely moti'63'd me to '42' '155' '515'—rolling '118' to '63' '500' as '137' as to '99'—"I '205' '678' a leg of ye."
"Good '168', l'6'lord," '136' I, "'1' '289' go."
I '391'ed in, '6' n'167' slept '166' in my '139'.

Upon waking '290' '339' '39' '183''703', I '295' Queequeg's arm '687'n '118' me in '4' '344' loving '6' affectionate '128'ner. You '97' al'344' '147' I '97' '91' '90' '362'. The '893'erpane '28' of patch'176', '597' of odd '105' '348'i-col'119'ed squ'36's '6' triangles; '6' '14' arm of '90' tat'111'ed '34' '118' '31' an intermin'473' Cretan labyrinth of a '575', no '149' '348's of '265' '85' of '63' precise s'97'e—o'768'g I '803' to '90' '184'ing '90' arm at sea un'559'hodic'34'y in sun '6' s'97'e, '90' shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various '464'—'14' '276' arm of '90', I '99', '720' '17' '34' '4' '296' '46' a s'798' of '7' '276' patch'176' quilt. Indeed, '348'ly '666' on it as '4' arm '64' '74' I '171' awoke, I '87' '321'ly '81' it '83' '4' quilt, '69' so bl'398'ed '238' hues to'42''49'; '6' it '28' '146' by '4' '587' of w'879' '6' pres'115' '7' I '87' '81' '7' Queequeg '28' hugging me.
My sensations '85' st'868'ge. Let me '244' to '656' '116'. When I '28' a '497', I '35' '219' a '96''11' similar circumstance '7' be'947' me; whe'4'r it '28' a '272'ity or a '710', I n'167' '87' '797'ly '451'tle. The circumstance '28' '14'. I '97' '91' '537'ting up '96' caper or '173'—I '54' it '28' '244'ing to crawl up '4' c'58'ney, as I '97' '333' a '105' sweep do a '360' '433' previous; '6' my '761'm'173' '94', '96''60' or '173', '28' '34' '4' '75' whipping me, or '642'ing me to '515' supper'759',—my m'173' dragged me by '4' legs '44' of '4' c'58'ney '6' packed me '141' to '515', '463' it '28' '146' '149' o'clock in '4' '180'noon of '4' 21st June, '4' '192'est '183' in '4' '407' in '119' hemisp'43'. I '577' d'504''597'y. But t'43' '28' no '148' '17' it, so up st'769's I '277' to my '105' '267' in '4' third '983', un'926'ed '302' as slowly as '622' so as to '320' '75', '6' '31' a '437'ter sigh '61' '592'ween '4' '50'ets.
I lay t'43' dism'34'y calculating '7' '578'teen '797' '520' '259' elapse '165' I '87' '274' '17' a resurrection. Sixteen '520' in '515'! '4' sm'34' of my '78' ached to '54' of it. And it '28' so '703' '111'; '4' sun shining in at '4' '768'dow, '6' a '164' rattling of coaches in '4' '811's, '6' '4' '602' of gay '915's '34' '118' '4' ho'364'. I '577' '623' '6' '623'—at '181' I '61' up, '926'ed, '6' softly '45' d'249' in my stockinged '908', sought '44' my '761'm'173', '6' suddenly threw '302' at '49' '908', be'66'ching '49' as a '348'icular fav'119' to '145' me a '68' slippe'847' '17' my misbehavi'119'; '138''124' indeed '33' condemning me to '596' a'515' '375' an un'398'ur'473' length of '75'. But '50' '28' '4' '258' '6' '344' conscientious of '761'm'173's, '6' '78' I '97' to go to my '267'. For s'167'al '520' I lay t'43' b'937' a'830', '174'ing a '164' '334' '623' '169' I '19' '167' d'63' '317', '140' '83' '4' '164'est subsequent mis'17'tunes. At '181' I '259' '19' f'34'en '155' a '461'd '168'm'36' of a doze; '6' slowly waking '83' it—'499' steeped in '710's—I '422'ed my '495', '6' '4' '165' sun-lit '267' '28' '56' wrapped in '44'er '967'ness. Instantly I '577' a shock '573' '209' '34' my frame; no'124' '28' to be '333', '6' no'124' '28' to be '299'; '33' a supernatural h'6' '562'ed '226'd in '462'. My arm hung '118' '4' '893'erpane, '6' '4' '275''759', unimagin'473', silent '17'm or phantom, to '265' '4' h'6' be'192'ed, '562'ed '452'ly s'545'ed by my '515'-'500'. For '11' '562'ed ages piled on ages, I lay t'43', frozen '31' '4' '344' awful fears, '23' da'847' to drag '170' my h'6'; '332' '167' '54'ing '7' if I '87' '33' stir it '63' single inch, '4' horrid spell '72' be '785'n. I k'212' '23' '60' '14' consciousness at '181' glided '170' '83' me; '33' waking in '4' '339', I shudde'847'ly '219'ed it '34', '6' '17' '433' '6' '731' '6' '611' '180''869'ds I '387' '302' in con'295'ing attempts to '656' '4' mystery. Nay, to '14' '131' '612', I of'606' puzzle '302' '31' it.
Now, '101' '170' '4' awful fear, '6' my sensations at '174'ing '4' supernatural h'6' in '462' '85' '131' similar, in '238' st'868'geness, to '200' '265' I experienced on waking up '6' '66'ing Queequeg's pagan arm '687'n round me. But at length '34' '4' '536' '168''s '140'ts soberly recur'796', '63' by '63', in '950'ed '272'ity, '6' '98' I lay '146' a'349' to '4' comical p'796'ica'508't. For '463' I '457' to '367' '90' arm—unlock '90' b'852'g'267' clasp—'332', '503'ing as he '28', he s'773' hugged me tightly, as '463' naught '33' '548' '134' '348' us twain. I '56' strove to ro'364' '58'—"Queequeg!"—'33' '90' '146' '491' '28' a snore. I '98' rolled '118', my neck '174'ing as if it '85' in a horse-collar; '6' suddenly '577' a s'703' scratch. Thro'768'g a'500' '4' '893'erpane, t'43' lay '4' tomahawk '503'ing by '4' savage's '500', as if it '85' a hatchet-'352'd '231'. A '281' '512'le, truly, '147' I; a'515' '43' in a st'868'ge ho'364' in '4' b'937' '183', '31' a '51'nibal '6' a tomahawk! "Queequeg!—in '4' '275' of '68'ness, Queequeg, '830'!" At length, by dint of '137' wriggling, '6' loud '6' incessant expostulations upon '4' unbe'260'ness of '90' hugging a '947'ow male in '7' matrimonial '563' of style, I succeeded in extr'735'ing a g'366't; '6' '986'ly, he drew '78' '90' arm, shook '58''968' '34' '118' '46' a New'295'l'6' '766' '22' '83' '4' '604', '6' sat up in '515', stiff as a pike-staff, '262' at me, '6' rubbing '90' '495' as if he '64' '23' alto'42''49' '219' '60' I '246' to be t'43', '463' a dim consciousness of kno'768'g so'559'hing '39' me '562'ed slowly dawning '118' '58'. Mean'313', I lay '935'ly '784'ing '58', '305' no '525' mis'631's '56', '6' bent upon narrowly observing so curious a cr'545'ure. When, at '181', '90' '241' '562'ed '721'e up '678'ing '4' char'735'er of '90' '515''947'ow, '6' he be'246', as it '85', reconciled to '4' '418'; he jumped '44' upon '4' '983', '6' by '979' '659's '6' '602's '417' me to '447'st'6' '7', if it '142'd me, he '72' '926' '171' '6' '98' '224' me to '926' '180''869'ds, '568' '4' '251' '814' to '302'. Thinks I, Queequeg, '447' '4' circumstances, '14' is a '131' civilized '118'ture; '33', '4' '350' is, '182' savages '19' an innate '587' of delicacy, '99' '11' '1' '76'; it is marvellous '60' es'708'i'34'y polite '69' '36'. I '490' '14' '348'icular compli'508't to Queequeg, beca'364' he tr'545'ed me '31' so '137' civility '6' con'500'ration, '313' I '28' guilty of '164' rudeness; sta'847' at '58' '83' '4' '515', '6' '763' '34' '90' toi'123'te motions; '17' '4' '75' my curio'421'y '42'ting '4' '166' of my breeding. N'167''4''759', a '128' '46' Queequeg '1' '21' '66' e'131' '183', he '6' '90' '103's '85' '35' '736' unusual regarding.
He com'508'ced '926'ing at '739' by donning '90' beaver hat, a '131' t'34' '63', by '4' by, '6' '98'—s'773' minus '90' trowsers—he hunted up '90' boots. What '447' '4' heavens he '64' it '17', I '51''23' '81', '33' '90' '290' '367''508't '28' to crush '58''968'—boots in h'6', '6' hat on—'447' '4' '515'; '74', '83' sundry violent gaspings '6' strainings, I infer'796' he '28' '321' at '176' booting '58''968'; '463' by no '749' of propriety '7' I '167' '299' of, is '138' '128' requi'796' to be '988' '74' '966' on '90' boots. But Queequeg, do '1' '66', '28' a cr'545'ure in '4' t'868''421'ion stage—'948' caterpillar nor '33'terfly. He '28' '22' '243' civilized to s'60' '141' '90' '44'l'6'ishness in '4' st'868'gest '622' '128'ners. His education '28' '23' '332' comp'123'ed. He '28' an '447'graduate. If he '97' '23' '91' a sm'34' degree civilized, he '131' '307' '72' '23' '19' '461'd '58''968' '31' boots at '34'; '33' '98', if he '97' '23' '91' s'773' a savage, he n'167' '72' '19' '710't of '42'ting '447' '4' '515' to '186' '116' on. At '181', he emerged '31' '90' hat '131' '137' dented '6' cru'50'd d'249' '118' '90' '495', '6' began creaking '6' limping '39' '4' '267', as if, '23' '213' '137' accustomed to boots, '90' p'769' of damp, wrinkled cowhide '913'—'307' '23' '721'e to '619' ei'4'r—'743' pinched '6' tor'508'ted '58' at '4' '171' go '141' of a '437'ter '690' '339'.
Seeing, '56', '7' t'43' '85' no curtains to '4' '768'dow, '6' '7' '4' '811' '213' '131' narrow, '4' ho'364' oppo'421'e com'128'ded a plain view '155' '4' '267', '6' observing '117' '6' '117' '4' indecorous '575' '7' Queequeg '721'e, staving '39' '31' '105' '234' '33' '90' hat '6' boots on; I begged '58' as '35' as I '87', to accelerate '90' toi'123' '96''11', '6' '348'icularly to '42' '155' '90' pantaloons as '358' as '622'. He comp'596'd, '6' '98' proceeded to '28'h '58''968'. At '7' '75' in '4' '339' '138' '917'tian '72' '19' wa'50'd '90' '352'; '33' Queequeg, to my amaze'508't, con'606'ted '58''968' '31' '426'ricting '90' ablutions to '90' chest, arms, '6' '524'. He '98' donned '90' waistcoat, '6' '409' up a '747' of '321' soap on '4' '28'h-st'6' centre t'473', dipped it '155' '604' '6' com'508'ced la'4''847' '90' '352'. I '28' '763' to '66' w'43' he '764' '90' razor, '74' lo '6' be'330', he '726' '4' harpoon '83' '4' '515' corner, slips '44' '4' '192' wooden stock, un'50'a'4's '4' '342', whets it a '105' on '90' boot, '6' striding up to '4' '437' of mirror '485' '4' w'34', begins a vigorous scraping, or '743' harpooning of '90' cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, '14' is '970' Rogers's '258' '537'lery '31' a vengeance. After'869'ds I wonde'796' '4' '759' at '14' operation '74' I '246' to k'56' of '11' '178' steel '4' '342' of a harpoon is '721'e, '6' '60' exceedingly sharp '4' '192' '688' edges '36' '194' '764'.
The '426' of '90' toi'123' '28' '358' achieved, '6' he '896'ly marched '44' of '4' '267', wrapped up in '90' '164' pi'202' monkey jacket, '6' sporting '90' harpoon '46' a marshal's baton.




CHAPTER 5. Break'692'.

I quickly '858'ed suit, '6' desc'398'ing '155' '4' '960'-'267' accosted '4' grinning l'6'lord '131' pleasantly. I c'49'i'50'd no mal'972' to'869'ds '58', '463' he '97' '91' skylarking '31' me '23' a '105' in '4' '301' of my '515''947'ow.
How'167', a '68' laugh is a '240'y '68' '124', '6' '743' '111' s'324'ce a '68' '124'; '4' '117''s '4' pity. So, if '138' '63' '128', in '90' '249' proper '369', af'17'd '343' '17' a '68' joke to '138''618', '123' '58' '23' be '78''869'd, '33' '123' '58' cheer'597'y '34'ow '58''968' to sp'398' '6' be '953' in '7' '103'. And '4' '128' '7' '129' '138''124' bounti'597'y laugh'473' '39' '58', be '115' t'43' is '117' in '7' '128' '169' '1' '760' '54' '17'.
The '960'-'267' '28' '56' '597' of '4' boarders '94' '97' '91' '705'ping in '4' '168' previous, '6' '94'm I '97' '23' as '332' '97' a '68' '73' at. T'84' '85' '958'ly '34' whale'508'; chief mates, '6' '347' mates, '6' third mates, '6' sea '324'penters, '6' sea coopers, '6' sea '751'smiths, '6' harpo'63'ers, '6' ship '184'ers; a br'249' '6' brawny '624', '31' bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy '451', '34' wea'847' monkey jackets '17' '339' g'249's.
You '87' '281' plainly '81' '60' '192' '356' '63' '97' '91' ashore. T'90' '507' '947'ow's healthy cheek is '46' a sun-toasted pear in hue, '6' '72' '562' to smell al'344' as musky; he '51''23' '19' '91' '291' '433' l'6'ed '83' '90' Indian voyage. That '128' '290' '58' '388' a '360' s'97'es '703'er; '1' '240' '99' a '678' of satin wood is in '58'. In '4' complexion of a third s'773' lingers a tropic tawn, '33' s'703'ly bl'356'ed '31'al; he doubt'759' '129' tarried '251' '731' ashore. But '94' '87' s'60' a cheek '46' Queequeg? '265', '960''796' '31' various tints, '562'ed '46' '4' Andes' western slope, to s'60' '17'th in '63' array, contrasting climates, z'63' by z'63'.
"Grub, ho!" '56' cried '4' l'6'lord, flinging '422' a '450', '6' in we '277' to '448''692'.
T'84' '99' '7' '508' '94' '19' '333' '4' '296', t'43'by be'67' '538' at ease in '128'ner, '538' '968'-possessed in '624'. Not '194', '463': Ledyard, '4' '164' New Engl'6' traveller, '6' Mungo Park, '4' Scotch '63'; of '34' '508', '69' possessed '4' '402' '652'u'868'ce in '4' parlor. But '760' '4' mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by '766's as Ledyard '64', or '4' '409' a '192' solitary '459' on an empty stomach, in '4' negro '374' of Africa, '265' '28' '4' sum of '719' Mungo's per'17''128'ces—'14' '207' of travel, I '99', '289' '23' be '4' '131' '258' mode of attaining a '530' social polish. S'773', '17' '4' '344' '348', '7' '563' of '124' is to be '97' '138'w'43'.
These reflections '22' '43' '36' occasi'63'd by '4' circumstance '7' '180' we '85' '34' s'545'ed at '4' t'473', '6' I '28' prepa'847' to '230' '96' '68' stories '39' whaling; to my no sm'34' '715', '958'ly e'131' '128' maintained a pro'295' silence. And '23' '146' '7', '33' '69' '720' em'960'r'652'ed. Yes, '43' '85' a '451' of sea-'766's, '128'y of '94'm '327' '4' s'703'est bashfulness '97' boarded '164' whales on '4' '530' seas—'797' st'868'gers to '116'—'6' duelled '116' '314' '327' '768'king; '6' '332', '43' '69' sat at a social '448''692' t'473'—'34' of '4' '276' c'34'ing, '34' of '207''796' tastes—'262' round as '50'epishly at '356' '173' as '463' '69' '97' n'167' '91' '44' of sight of '96' '50'epf'261' among '4' Green Mountains. A curious sight; '182' bashful bears, '182' timid '869'rior whale'508'!
But as '17' Queequeg—'65', Queequeg sat t'43' among '116'—at '4' '342' of '4' t'473', '111', it so '365'd; as '494' as an icicle. To be '115' I '51''23' '99' '137' '17' '90' breeding. His '164'est admirer '87' '23' '19' cordi'34'y '22'ified '90' b'847'ing '90' harpoon '155' '448''692' '31' '58', '6' '970' it t'43' '327' ceremony; r'356'ing '118' '4' t'473' '31' it, to '4' im'462'nt jeopardy of '128'y '342's, '6' grappling '4' beefsteaks to'869'ds '58'. But '7' '28' '658' '131' '494'ly d'63' by '58', '6' e'131' '63' '359' '7' in '344' '151''s estimation, to do '138''124' '494'ly is to do it genteelly.
We '76' '23' '613' of '34' Queequeg's peculiarities '43'; '60' he eschewed c'141'ee '6' '576' rolls, '6' app'596'd '90' undivided at'606'tion to beefsteaks, d'63' r'36'.

CHAPTER 6. The Street.

If I '97' '91' astoni'50'd at '171' '756'ing a glimpse of so '44'l'6'ish an individual as Queequeg circulating among '4' polite society of a civilized t'249', '7' astonish'508't '358' de'348'ed upon '409' my '171' '183''703' stroll '209' '4' '811's of New Bed'17'd.
In thoroughf'36's nigh '4' docks, '138' con'500'r'473' seaport '76' frequently '141'er to view '4' quee'426' '262' nondescripts '83' '17'eign '348's.

Regent Street is '23' un'677' to Las'324's '6' Malays; '6' at Bombay, in '4' Apollo Green, '349' Yankees '19' of'606' s'324'ed '4' natives. But New Bed'17'd '942's '34' Water Street '6' Wapping. In '182' '181'-'508'ti'63'd h'976's '1' '66' '146' sailors; '33' in New Bed'17'd, '735'ual '51'nibals st'6' chatting at '811' corners; savages '44''40'; '128'y of '94'm '332' '324'ry on '238' b'913' unholy flesh. It '408' a st'868'ger st'36'.
But, be'500's '4' Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erro'128'ggoans, Pannangians, '6' Brighggians, '6', be'500's '4' wild speci'508's of '4' whaling-craft '265' unheeded reel '39' '4' '811's, '1' '76' '66' '173' sights s'773' '117' curious, '658' '117' comical. T'43' '532'ly arrive in '14' t'249' scores of green Vermonters '6' New Hampshire '508', '34' athirst '17' gain '6' glory in '4' fi'50'ry. T'84' '36' '344'ly '507', of stal'869't frames; '947'ows '94' '19' '947'ed fo'426's, '6' '56' '66'k to '705' '4' axe '6' snatch '4' whale-lance. M'138' '36' as green as '4' Green Mountains '74'ce '69' '246'. In '96' '124's '1' '72' '54' '116' '33' a '360' '520' '261'. Look t'43'! '7' chap strutting round '4' corner. He '854's a beaver hat '6' sw'34'ow-tailed coat, girdled '31' a sailor-belt '6' '50'ath-knife. Here '67's an'173' '31' a sou'-wester '6' a bombazine cloak.
No t'249'-b'796' d'6'y '76' comp'36' '31' a '893'ry-b'796' '63'—I '80' a d'249''40' bumpkin d'6'y—a '947'ow '7', in '4' '766'-'433', '76' mow '90' '149' acres in buckskin g'112's '17' fear of tanning '90' '524'. Now '74' a '893'ry d'6'y '46' '14' '726' it '155' '90' '342' to '106' a distingui'50'd re'186'ation, '6' joins '4' '164' whale-fi'50'ry, '1' '134' '66' '4' comical '124's he '185' upon r'356'ing '4' seaport. In be'613'ing '90' sea-'44'fit, he '619's bell-'33'tons to '90' waistcoats; straps to '90' '51'vas trowsers. Ah, '719' Hay-Seed! '60' '437'terly '76' burst '200' straps in '4' '171' '60'ling gale, '74' thou art '698'n, straps, '33'tons, '6' '34', d'249' '4' throat of '4' tempest.
But '54' '23' '7' '14' famous t'249' '129' '146' harpo'63'ers, '51'nibals, '6' bumpkins to s'60' '49' vi'421'ors. Not at '34'. S'773' New Bed'17'd is a queer '226'.

As it is, '348's of '49' '78' '893'ry '36' '243' to frigh'606' '63', '69' '73' so bony. The t'249' '716'elf is '760' '4' de'36'st '226' to '349' in, in '34' New Engl'6'. It is a l'6' of oil, '354' '243': '33' '23' '46' Canaan; a l'6', '516', of corn '6' '768'e. The '811's do '23' '366' '31' milk; nor in '4' sp'847'-'75' do '69' pave '116' '31' fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of '14', '56''43' in '34' America '76' '1' '156' '117' patrician-'46' ho'364's; parks '6' gardens '117' opulent, '169' in New Bed'17'd. Whence '246' '69'? '60' '519'ted upon '14' '336' scraggy scoria of a '893'ry?
Go '6' gaze upon '4' iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty '128'sion, '6' y'119' '455' '76' be '491'ed. Yes; '34' '182' brave ho'364's '6' fl'969'ry gardens '246' '83' '4' Atlantic, Pacific, '6' Indian oceans. One '6' '34', '69' '85' harpo'63'd '6' dragged up '479''49' '83' '4' bottom of '4' sea. Can Herr Alex'6'er per'17'm a f'545' '46' '7'?
In New Bed'17'd, '233's, '69' '99', '145' whales '17' d'969'rs to '238' '443's, '6' portion '141' '238' nieces '31' a '360' porpoises a-'747'. You '259' go to New Bed'17'd to '66' a brilliant '471'; '17', '69' '99', '69' '19' reservoirs of oil in e'131' ho'364', '6' e'131' '168' reck'759'ly burn '238' lengths in spermaceti '51'dles.
In summer '75', '4' t'249' is '584' to '66'; '597' of '178' maples—'192' avenues of green '6' g'261'. And in August, '530' in '769', '4' '416' '6' bountiful horse-chestnuts, '51'delabra-wise, pr'141'er '4' '962'er-by '238' '890''847' up'40' c'913' of congregated blossoms. So omnipo'606't is art; '265' in '128'y a district of New Bed'17'd '129' superinduced b'40' terraces of fl'969'rs upon '4' '960'ren ref'364' rocks '687'n a'500' at cr'545'ion's final '183'.
And '4' '607' of New Bed'17'd, '69' bloom '46' '238' '249' '796' roses. But roses '146' bloom in summer; w'43'as '4' '178' '324'nation of '238' cheeks is perennial as sun'703' in '4' s'140'th heavens. Elsew'43' match '7' bloom of '238's, ye '51''23', '550' in Salem, w'43' '69' '81' me '4' '507' '641' brea'4' '375' musk, '238' sailor '584''374's smell '116' miles '141' shore, as '463' '69' '85' dra'768'g nigh '4' odorous Moluccas '861' of '4' Puritanic s'6's.




CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.

In '14' '276' New Bed'17'd t'43' st'6's a Whale'128''s Chapel, '6' '360' '36' '4' moody fi'50'r'508', '940'ly bound '17' '4' Indian Ocean or Pacific, '94' fail to '106' a Sun'183' vi'421' to '4' spot. I am '115' '7' I '64' '23'.
Re'391'ing '83' my '171' '339' stroll, I '158' s'34'ied '44' upon '14' '591' err'6'. The sky '97' '397'd '83' '574', sunny '690', to driving sleet '6' mist. Wrapping '302' in my shaggy jacket of '4' c'202'h c'34'ed bearskin, I fought my '103' '485' '4' stubborn storm. Ente'847', I '295' a sm'34' scatte'796' congregation of sailors, '6' sailors' wives '6' widows. A muffled silence reigned, '146' '785'n at '464' by '4' shrieks of '4' storm. Each silent worshipper '562'ed purposely '812' a'348' '83' '4' '173', as if '356' silent grief '85' insular '6' incommunic'473'. The chaplain '97' '23' '332' arrived; '6' t'43' '182' silent isl'6's of '508' '6' '607' sat stead'692'ly '784'ing s'167'al marble tab'123's, '31' '751' b'619's, mas'63'd '155' '4' w'34' on ei'4'r '500' '4' pulpit. Three of '116' '868' so'559'hing '46' '4' '858'ing, '33' I do '23' pre'606'd to quote:—
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at '4' age of '879'een, '28' '387' '118'board, Near '4' Isle of Desolation, '141' Pat'414'nia, November 1st, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to '90' Memory BY HIS SISTE'695'

Shaking '141' '4' sleet '83' my '972'-glazed hat '6' jacket, I s'545'ed '302' '958' '4' '450', '6' '391'ing '500''103's '28' '715'd to '66' Queequeg '958' me. Affected by '4' solemnity of '4' scene, t'43' '28' a '909' gaze of inc'796'ulous curio'421'y in '90' coun'606'ance. T'90' savage '28' '4' '146' '369' '986' '94' '562'ed to '23''972' my ent'868'ce; beca'364' he '28' '4' '146' '63' '94' '87' '23' '504', '6', t'43''17'e, '28' '23' '504'ing '200' frigid inscriptions on '4' w'34'. Whe'4'r '138' of '4' relatives of '4' sea'508' '94'se '275's appea'796' t'43' '85' '56' among '4' congregation, I k'212' '23'; '33' so '128'y '36' '4' unrecorded '829's in '4' fi'50'ry, '6' so plainly '64' s'167'al '607' '986' '854' '4' coun'606'ance if '23' '4' trappings of '96' unceasing grief, '7' I '174' '115' '7' '43' '165' me '85' '652'514'bled '200', in '94'se unhealing '374's '4' sight of '200' bleak tab'123's sympa'4'tic'34'y ca'364'd '4' '261' wounds to bleed afresh.
Oh! ye '94'se '314' '596' buried ben'545'h '4' green gr'652'; '94' st'6'ing among fl'969'rs '51' '99'—'43', '43' '596's my be'112'd; ye k'56' '23' '4' desolation '7' broods in bosoms '46' '182'. What '437'ter blanks in '200' '751'-b'619'ed marbles '265' c'118' no a'50's! What desp'769' in '200' immov'473' inscriptions! What '314'ly voids '6' unbidden infidelities in '4' '518's '7' '562' to gnaw upon '34' Faith, '6' ref'364' resurrections to '4' '213's '94' '19' '226''759'ly peri'50'd '327' a grave. As '35' '240' '200' tab'123's st'6' in '4' cave of Elephanta as '43'.
In '11' census of '565' cr'545'ures, '4' '314' of '128''207' '36' included; '65' it is '7' a universal '831'rb '415' of '116', '7' '69' '81' no tales, '463' containing '117' '669's '169' '4' Good'768' S'6's; '60' it is '7' to '90' '275' '94' '89'ter'183' de'348'ed '17' '4' '173' '296', we pre'950' so '659'ifi'51't '6' infidel a '429', '6' '332' do '23' thus entitle '58', if he '33' em'960'ks '17' '4' remo'704' In'474's of '14' '565' '987'; '65' '4' Life Insu'868'ce Companies '490' '548'-'17'feitures upon immortals; in '11' eternal, unstir'847' paralysis, '6' '314'ly, '274''759' t'868'ce, '332' '596's antique Adam '94' '474'd '578'ty round centuries '414'; '60' it is '7' we s'773' ref'364' to be com'17'ted '17' '200' '94' we n'167''4''759' maintain '36' d'35'ing in un'613''473' bliss; '65' '34' '4' '565' so strive to hush '34' '4' '314'; w'43''17'e '33' '4' rumor of a knocking in a tomb '76' terrify a '251' '709'. All '182' '124's '36' '23' '327' '238' '80'ings.
But Faith, '46' a jackal, feeds among '4' tombs, '6' '140' '83' '182' '314' doubts '50' ga'4'rs '49' '344' vital '274'.
It '460' s'324'cely to be '163', '31' '11' '699', on '4' eve of a Nantucket voyage, I regarded '200' marble tab'123's, '6' by '4' murky '703' of '7' '967'ened, doleful '183' '504' '4' fate of '4' whale'508' '94' '97' g'63' '165' me. Yes, Ishmael, '4' '276' fate '289' be thine. But '96''60' I grew merry '158'. De'703'ful induce'508'ts to em'960'k, '178' '365' '17' promotion, it '562's—aye, a stove boat '76' '106' me an immortal by brevet. Yes, t'43' is '548' in '14' '355' of whaling—a speech'759'ly quick chaotic bundling of a '128' '155' Eternity. But '11' '98'? Me'54's we '19' hugely mis'645' '14' '301' of Life '6' D'545'h.

And t'43''17'e '291' cheers '17' Nantucket; '6' '67' a stove boat '6' stove '618' '74' '69' '76', '17' stave my soul, Jove '58''968' '51''23'.




CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.

I '97' '23' '91' s'545'ed '131' '192' ere a '128' of a '979' vener'473' robustness ente'796'; immediately as '4' storm-pelted '450' flew '78' upon '774'ting '58', a quick regardful '784'ing of '58' by '34' '4' congregation, sufficiently at'704'ed '7' '14' '178' '261' '128' '28' '4' chaplain. Yes, it '28' '4' famous Fa'4'r Mapple, so c'34'ed by '4' whale'508', among '94'm he '28' a '131' '164' fav'119'ite. He '97' '91' a sailor '6' a harpo'63'er in '90' '1'th, '33' '17' '128'y '266' '536' '97' dedicated '90' '139' to '4' minis'244'. At '4' '75' I '56' '863' of, Fa'4'r Mapple '28' in '4' '321'y '768'ter of a healthy '261' age; '7' '563' of '261' age '265' '562's merging '155' a '347' fl'969''847' '1'th, '17' among '34' '4' fis'115's of '90' wrinkles, t'43' sh'63' '979' mild gleams of a '212'ly developing bloom—'4' sp'847' verdure peeping '17'th '140' ben'545'h February's s'56'. No '63' '305' previously '299' '90' '903', '87' '17' '4' '171' '75' be'330' Fa'4'r Mapple '327' '4' ut'344' inte'426', beca'364' t'43' '85' '979' engrafted clerical peculiarities '39' '58', im'186''473' to '7' adventurous mari'75' '139' he '97' led. When he ente'796' I observed '7' he '324'ried no umbrella, '6' '658' '97' '23' '67' in '90' '324'riage, '17' '90' tarpaulin hat '868' d'249' '31' melting sleet, '6' '90' '164' pi'202' c'202'h jacket '562'ed al'344' to drag '58' to '4' '983' '31' '4' w'879' of '4' '604' it '97' absor'515'. How'167', hat '6' coat '6' '118'shoes '85' '63' by '63' re'367'd, '6' hung up in a '105' space in an adjacent corner; '74', arrayed in a decent suit, he '935'ly approached '4' pulpit.
Like '344' '261' fashi'63'd pulp'716', it '28' a '131' lofty '63', '6' '317' a regular st'769's to '375' a h'879' '72', by '716' '192' angle '31' '4' '983', '525'ly contr'735' '4' '287' sm'34' '36'a of '4' chapel, '4' arc'479'ect, it '562'ed, '97' '735'ed upon '4' hint of Fa'4'r Mapple, '6' '914'ed '4' pulpit '327' a st'769's, substituting a perp'398'icular '500' ladder, '46' '200' '364'd in mounting a ship '83' a boat at sea. The '362' of a whaling captain '97' provided '4' chapel '31' a '524'ome p'769' of '796' '1000'ed '128'-ropes '17' '14' ladder, '265', '213' '716'elf n'972'ly '342'ed, '6' stained '31' a mahog'138' col'119', '4' '251' contrivance, con'500''847' '11' '128'ner of chapel it '28', '562'ed by no '410' in '217' taste. Halting '17' an instant at '4' foot of '4' ladder, '6' '31' '312' '524' grasping '4' orna'508'tal knobs of '4' '128'-ropes, Fa'4'r Mapple cast a '73' up'869'ds, '6' '98' '31' a truly sailor-'46' '33' s'773' r'167'ential dexterity, h'6' '118' h'6', mounted '4' '761's as if asc'398'ing '4' main-'739' of '90' vessel.
The perp'398'icular '348's of '14' '500' ladder, as is usu'34'y '4' '390' '31' s'768'ging '913', '85' of c'202'h-c'118'ed rope, '146' '4' rounds '85' of wood, so '7' at e'131' '761' t'43' '28' a joint. At my '171' glimpse of '4' pulpit, it '97' '23' escaped me '7' '60''167' convenient '17' a ship, '182' joints in '4' '986' instance '562'ed unnecessary. For I '28' '23' prepa'796' to '66' Fa'4'r Mapple '180' gaining '4' h'879', slowly '391' round, '6' s'111'ping '118' '4' pulpit, deliberately drag up '4' ladder '761' by '761', '773' '4' '251' '28' depo'421'ed '31'in, '568' '58' impregn'473' in '90' '105' Quebec.
I ponde'796' '96' '75' '327' '597'y compreh'398'ing '4' '385' '17' '14'. Fa'4'r Mapple '932'ed '375' a wide re'186'ation '17' '317'rity '6' sanctity, '7' I '87' '23' suspect '58' of c'119'ting '23'oriety by '138' mere tricks of '4' stage. No, '147' I, t'43' '259' be '96' sober '385' '17' '14' '124'; fur'4'r'117', it '259' symbolize so'559'hing un'333'. Can it be, '98', '7' by '7' '735' of physical isolation, he '659'ifies '90' spiritual '31'drawal '17' '4' '75', '83' '34' '44''869'd '296'ly ties '6' connexions? Yes, '17' repleni'50'd '31' '4' m'545' '6' '768'e of '4' '429', to '4' faithful '128' of God, '14' pulpit, I '66', is a '968'-containing '777''330'—a lofty Ehrenbre'716'tein, '31' a perennial '35' of '604' '31'in '4' w'34's.
But '4' '500' ladder '28' '23' '4' '146' st'868'ge f'545'ure of '4' '226', borr'969'd '83' '4' chaplain's '17'mer sea-fa'847's. Between '4' marble ce'23'aphs on ei'4'r h'6' of '4' pulpit, '4' w'34' '265' '17'med '716' '78' '28' adorned '31' a large '684'ting re'986'ing a g'34'ant ship '942'ing '485' a '816' storm '141' a lee coast of '751' rocks '6' s'56'y '448'ers. But '530' above '4' f'666' scud '6' '967'-rolling clouds, t'43' floated a '105' isle of sun'703', '83' '265' beamed '17'th an angel's '352'; '6' '14' b'40' '352' '50'd a distinct spot of radiance upon '4' ship's tossed deck, so'559'hing '46' '7' silver p'399' '56' inserted '155' '4' '951'y's '519'k w'43' Nel'273' '947'. "Ah, noble ship," '4' angel '562'ed to '99', "'942' on, '942' on, thou noble ship, '6' bear a '321'y helm; '17' lo! '4' sun is '448'ing '209'; '4' clouds '36' rolling '141'—serenest azure is at h'6'."
Nor '28' '4' pulpit '716'elf '327' a trace of '4' '276' sea-taste '7' '97' achieved '4' ladder '6' '4' '648'. Its panelled '569' '28' in '4' '46'ness of a ship's bluff bows, '6' '4' Holy Bible '426'ed on a projecting '747' of scroll '176', fashi'63'd '180' a ship's fiddle-'342'ed beak.
What '87' be '117' '597' of '80'ing?—'17' '4' pulpit is '167' '14' '987''s '17'e'344' '348'; '34' '4' '426' '67's in '716' rear; '4' pulpit leads '4' '296'. From '98'ce it is '4' storm of God's quick wrath is '171' descried, '6' '4' bow '259' bear '4' ear'596'st b'366't. From '98'ce it is '4' God of breezes '807' or foul is '171' invoked '17' fav'119''473' '768'ds. Yes, '4' '296''s a ship on '716' '962'age '44', '6' '23' a voyage comp'123'e; '6' '4' pulpit is '716' prow.




CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.

Fa'4'r Mapple rose, '6' in a mild '915' of un'652'uming authority '619'ed '4' scatte'796' '151' to condense. "Starboard gang'103', t'43'! '500' '170' to larboard—larboard gang'103' to starboard! Midships! midships!"
T'43' '28' a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among '4' benches, '6' a s'773' s'703'er shuffling of '607''s shoes, '6' '34' '28' '935' '158', '6' e'131' '784' on '4' pr'356'er.
He pa'364'd a '105'; '98' kneeling in '4' pulp'30' bows, f'261'ed '90' large br'249' '524' across '90' chest, uplifted '90' '452'd '495', '6' '141'e'796' a prayer so deeply dev'44' '7' he '562'ed kneeling '6' praying at '4' bottom of '4' sea.
T'90' '398'ed, in pro'192'ed solemn t'913', '46' '4' continual tolling of a bell in a ship '7' is fo'447'ing at sea in a fog—in '375' t'913' he com'508'ced '504'ing '4' '858'ing hymn; '33' c'621'ing '90' '128'ner to'869'ds '4' concluding stanzas, burst '17'th '31' a pealing exultation '6' joy—
     "The ribs '6' terrors in '4' whale,
     Arched '118' me a dismal gloom,
     While '34' God's sun-lit waves rolled by,
     And lift me deepening d'249' to doom.

     "I '282' '4' '422'ing maw of '245',
     With '398''759' '684's '6' sorrows t'43';
     Which '697' '33' '69' '7' '174' '51' '81'—
     Oh, I '28' plunging to desp'769'.

     "In '751' distress, I c'34'ed my God,
     When I '87' s'324'ce '172' '58' '462',
     He b'969'd '90' ear to my complaints—
     No '117' '4' whale '64' me con'178'.

     "With speed he flew to my re'596'f,
     As on a radiant dolphin borne;
     Awful, '332' b'40', as '703'ning sh'63'
     The '352' of my De'349'rer God.

     "My '273'g '17' '167' sh'34' record
     That '816', '7' joyful '612';
     I '145' '4' glory to my God,
     His '34' '4' mercy '6' '4' '637'."
N'865' '34' joined in singing '14' hymn, '265' s'35'ed '530' above '4' '60'ling of '4' storm. A brief pa'364' ensued; '4' pr'356'er slowly '391'ed '118' '4' '224's of '4' Bible, '6' at '181', f'261'ing '90' h'6' d'249' upon '4' proper page, '136': "Be'112'd shipmates, clinch '4' '181' verse of '4' '171' chapter of Jonah—'And God '97' prepa'796' a '164' fish to sw'34'ow up Jonah.'"
"Shipmates, '14' '560', containing '146' '492' chapters—'492' yarns—is '63' of '4' sm'34'est str'6's in '4' '240'y c'473' of '4' Scriptures. Yet '11' depths of '4' soul '185' Jonah's deep sea'518' '602'! '11' a '844' '759'on to us is '14' prophet! What a noble '124' is '7' '51'ticle in '4' fish's belly! How '899'ow-'46' '6' boisterously gr'6'! We '174' '4' floods surging '118' us; we '602' '31' '58' to '4' kelpy bottom of '4' '604's; sea-weed '6' '34' '4' slime of '4' sea is '39' us! But '11' is '14' '759'on '7' '4' '560' of Jonah t'356'es? Shipmates, it is a '149'-str'6'ed '759'on; a '759'on to us '34' as sinful '508', '6' a '759'on to me as a pi'202' of '4' '565' God. As sinful '508', it is a '759'on to us '34', beca'364' it is a '480' of '4' sin, '321'-'374'edness, suddenly a'830'ned fears, '4' swift punish'508't, repentance, prayers, '6' fin'34'y '4' de'349''868'ce '6' joy of Jonah. As '31' '34' sinners among '508', '4' sin of '14' '273' of Amittai '28' in '90' wilful disobe'474'nce of '4' com'128'd of God—n'167' '241' '56' '11' '7' com'128'd '28', or '60' conv'784'd—'265' he '295' a '321' com'128'd. But '34' '4' '124's '7' God '72' '19' us do '36' '321' '17' us to do—'219' '7'—'6' hence, he of'606'er com'128'ds us '169' '398'eavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we '259' disobey '119'selves; '6' it is in '14' disobeying '119'selves, w'43'in '4' '321'ness of obeying God consists.
"With '14' sin of disobe'474'nce in '58', Jonah s'773' fur'4'r fl'44's at God, by '66'king to flee '83' Him. He '54's '7' a ship '721'e by '508' '76' '324'ry '58' '155' '893'ries w'43' God '185' '23' reign, '33' '146' '4' Captains of '14' '987'. He skulks '39' '4' wharves of Joppa, '6' '66'ks a ship '55' bound '17' Tars'90'h. T'43' lurks, '760', a '479''49'to unheeded '80'ing '43'. By '34' ac'893's Tars'90'h '87' '19' '91' no '173' '709' '169' '4' modern Cadiz. That's '4' opinion of '819'ed '508'. And w'43' is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in S'684'; as '458' by '604', '83' Joppa, as Jonah '87' '999' '19' sailed in '200' ancient '433', '74' '4' Atlantic '28' an al'344' un'677' sea. Beca'364' Joppa, '4' modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on '4' '344' easterly coast of '4' Mediter'868'ean, '4' Syrian; '6' Tars'90'h or Cadiz '117' '169' '149' thous'6' miles to '4' west'869'd '83' '7', '22' '44''500' '4' Stra'716' of Gibraltar. See ye '23' '98', shipmates, '7' Jonah sought to flee '296'-wide '83' God? Miser'473' '128'! Oh! '344' contemptible '6' '736'y of '34' scorn; '31' slouched hat '6' guilty '784', skulking '83' '90' God; prowling among '4' shipping '46' a vile burglar '129''606'ing to cross '4' seas. So dis'619'ed, '968'-condemning is '90' '73', '7' '97' t'43' '91' '476''508' in '200' '433', Jonah, on '4' mere suspicion of so'559'hing '208', '97' '91' ar'426'ed ere he '678'ed a deck. How plainly '86' a fugitive! no baggage, '23' a hat-'990', valise, or '324'pet-bag,—no fri'398's ac'624' '58' to '4' wharf '31' '238' a'474'ux. At '181', '180' '137' dodging search, he '156's '4' Tars'90'h ship receiving '4' '181' items of '49' '324'go; '6' as he '761's on board to '66' '716' Captain in '4' cabin, '34' '4' sailors '17' '4' mo'508't desist '83' hoisting in '4' '68's, to mark '4' st'868'ger's '779' '784'. Jonah '66's '14'; '33' in vain he tries to '73' '34' ease '6' confidence; in vain es'415' '90' wretched smile. Strong intuitions of '4' '128' '652'ure '4' mariners he '51' be no innocent. In '238' '544''96' '33' s'773' '525' '103', '63' w'90'pers to '4' '173'—"'254', '86' rob'515' a widow;" or, "Joe, do '1' mark '58'; '86' a '201'amist;" or, "Harry lad, I '214' '86' '4' adulterer '7' '785' '872' in '261' Gomorrah, or be'46', '63' of '4' '376'ing '776'ers '83' Sodom." An'173' '366's to '504' '4' '899' '55' stuck '485' '4' spile upon '4' wharf to '265' '4' ship is moo'796', '141'e'847' '401' hund'796' g'261' coins '17' '4' apprehension of a parricide, '6' containing a description of '90' '369'. He '504's, '6' '388' '83' Jonah to '4' '899'; '313' '34' '90' sympa'4'tic shipmates '56' crowd round Jonah, prepa'796' to lay '238' '524' upon '58'. F'40'ed Jonah trembles, '6' summoning '34' '90' b'261'ness to '90' '352', '146' '388' so '137' '4' '117' a co'869'd. He '76' '23' confess '58''968' suspected; '33' '7' '716'elf is '777' suspicion. So he '408' '4' '258' of it; '6' '74' '4' sailors '156' '58' '23' to be '4' '128' '7' is advertised, '69' '123' '58' '962', '6' he desc'398's '155' '4' cabin.
"'Who's t'43'?' cries '4' Captain at '90' '748' desk, hurriedly '380' '44' '90' '888's '17' '4' Customs—'Who's t'43'?' Oh! '60' '7' harm'759' '455' '128'gles Jonah! For '4' instant he al'344' '391's to flee '158'. But he r'34'ies. 'I '66'k a '962'age in '14' ship to Tars'90'h; '60' '358' sail ye, '284'?' Thus '458' '4' '748' Captain '97' '23' '720' up to Jonah, '463' '4' '128' '56' st'6's '165' '58'; '33' no '358'er '185' he '230' '7' hollow '915', '169' he darts a scrutinizing glance. 'We sail '31' '4' '290' '260' tide,' at '181' he slowly '491'ed, s'773' in'606'tly '784'ing '58'. 'No '358'er, '284'?'—'Soon '243' '17' '138' h'913't '128' '7' '547' a '962'enger.' Ha! Jonah, '55' an'173' stab. But he swiftly c'34's '170' '4' Captain '83' '7' scent. ''82' sail '31' ye,'—he '415',—''4' '962'age m'63'y '60' '137' is '7'?—'82' '490' '56'.' For it is '348'icularly writ'606', shipmates, as if it '85' a '124' '23' to be '118''720' in '14' '903', ''7' he paid '4' f'36' t'43'of' ere '4' craft '64' sail. And '645' '31' '4' context, '14' is '597' of '80'ing.
"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, '28' '63' '94'se discern'508't detects crime in '138', '33' '94'se cupidity exposes it '146' in '4' penni'759'. In '14' '296', shipmates, sin '7' '490's '716' '103' '51' travel '523'ly, '6' '327' a '962'port; w'43'as Virtue, if a pauper, is '188'ped at '34' '569'iers. So Jonah's Captain prep'36's to '704' '4' length of Jonah's purse, ere he '993' '58' '422'ly. He charges '58' thr'972' '4' usual sum; '6' '30' as'708'ed to. Then '4' Captain '359' '7' Jonah is a fugitive; '33' at '4' '276' '75' resolves to '148' a f'703' '7' paves '716' rear '31' g'261'. Yet '74' Jonah '807'ly '726' '44' '90' purse, prudent suspicions s'773' molest '4' Captain. He '847's e'131' coin to '156' a '893'erfeit. Not a '17'ger, '138' '103', he mutters; '6' Jonah is '186' d'249' '17' '90' '962'age. 'Point '44' my '892'-'267', Sir,' '415' Jonah '56', ''16' travel-'854'y; I '107' '503'.' 'Thou '73'est '46' it,' '415' '4' Captain, 't'43''s thy '267'.' Jonah enters, '6' '72' lock '4' '450', '33' '4' lock contains no key. Hea'847' '58' foolishly fumbling t'43', '4' Captain laughs lowly to '58''968', '6' mutters so'559'hing '39' '4' '450's of convicts' cells '213' n'167' '34''969'd to be locked '31'in. All '926'ed '6' dusty as he is, Jonah '687's '58''968' '155' '90' berth, '6' '156's '4' '105' '892'-'267' ceiling al'344' '426'ing on '90' '17'e'342'. The '769' is '452', '6' Jonah gasps. Then, in '7' contr'735'ed hole, sunk, '111', ben'545'h '4' ship's '604'-'518', Jonah '174's '4' '49'alding '986'i'508't of '7' stifling '612', '74' '4' whale sh'34' '330' '58' in '4' sm'34'est of '90' b'969'ls' '869'ds.
"Screwed at '716' axis '485' '4' '500', a s'768'ging lamp s'703'ly oscil'399's in Jonah's '267'; '6' '4' ship, heeling '118' to'869'ds '4' wharf '31' '4' w'879' of '4' '181' bales received, '4' lamp, flame '6' '34', '463' in s'703' motion, s'773' maintains a per'128'ent obliquity '31' reference to '4' '267'; '463', in '350', inf'34'ibly '688' '716'elf, it '33' '721'e obvious '4' false, '666' levels among '265' it hung. The lamp alarms '6' frigh'606's Jonah; as '666' in '90' berth '90' tor'508'ted '495' roll round '4' '226', '6' '14' thus '458' successful fugitive '156's no refuge '17' '90' '426''759' glance. But '7' contradiction in '4' lamp '117' '6' '117' appals '58'. The '983', '4' ceiling, '6' '4' '500', '36' '34' awry. 'Oh! so my conscience '621's in me!' he groans, ''688' up'869'ds, so it burns; '33' '4' chambers of my soul '36' '34' in crookedness!'
"Like '63' '94' '180' a '168' of d'366'ken revelry hies to '90' '515', s'773' reeling, '33' '31' conscience '332' pricking '58', as '4' plungings of '4' Ro'128' race-horse '33' so '137' '4' '117' strike '90' steel tags '155' '58'; as '63' '94' in '7' miser'473' p'703' s'773' '391's '6' '391's in giddy anguish, praying God '17' annihilation '326' '4' fit be '962'ed; '6' at '181' amid '4' whirl of woe he '174's, a deep stupor steals '118' '58', as '118' '4' '128' '94' bleeds to '548', '17' conscience is '4' wound, '6' t'43''s naught to staunch it; so, '180' sore w'426'lings in '90' berth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags '58' dr'249'ing d'249' to '503'.
"And '56' '4' '75' of tide '129' '67'; '4' ship casts '141' '49' c'473's; '6' '83' '4' deserted wharf '4' unchee'796' ship '17' Tars'90'h, '34' '324'eening, glides to sea. That ship, my fri'398's, '28' '4' '171' of recorded smugglers! '4' contrab'6' '28' Jonah. But '4' sea rebels; he '76' '23' bear '4' wicked burden. A d'504'ful storm '67's on, '4' ship is '46' to '448'. But '56' '74' '4' boatswain c'34's '34' '524' to ligh'606' '49'; '74' '990'es, bales, '6' jars '36' clatte'847' '118'board; '74' '4' '768'd is shrieking, '6' '4' '508' '36' yelling, '6' e'131' '519'k th'447's '31' trampling '908' '40' '118' Jonah's '342'; in '34' '14' raging tumult, Jonah '503's '90' hideous '503'. He '66's no '751' sky '6' raging sea, '174's '23' '4' reeling timbers, '6' '105' '230's he or heeds he '4' '458' rush of '4' '240'y whale, '265' '140' '56' '31' '422' '843' is c'568' '4' seas '180' '58'. Aye, shipmates, Jonah '28' g'63' d'249' '155' '4' '500's of '4' ship—a berth in '4' cabin as I '19' '645' it, '6' '28' '692' a'503'. But '4' frigh'606'ed master '67's to '58', '6' shrieks in '90' '314' ear, 'What '80'est thou, O, '503'er! arise!' Startled '83' '90' '123'hargy by '7' direful cry, Jonah staggers to '90' '908', '6' stumbling to '4' deck, grasps a shroud, to '73' '44' upon '4' sea. But at '7' mo'508't he is sp'366'g upon by a pan'4'r '899'ow leaping '118' '4' bul'869'ks. Wave '180' wave thus leaps '155' '4' ship, '6' '156'ing no speedy vent '366's roa'847' '17'e '6' aft, '773' '4' mariners '67' nigh to dr'249'ing '313' '332' afloat. And '167', as '4' '691' moon s'60's '49' aff'40'ed '352' '83' '4' steep gul'596's in '4' '751'ness '118''342', ag'129't Jonah '66's '4' rea'847' bowsprit '378'ing '530' up'869'd, '33' '358' '942' d'249''869'd '158' to'869'ds '4' tor'508'ted deep.
"Terrors upon terrors '366' sh'44'ing '209' '90' soul. In '34' '90' c'847'ing attitudes, '4' God-fugitive is '56' '111' plainly '677'. The sailors mark '58'; '117' '6' '117' '979' grow '238' suspicions of '58', '6' at '181', '597'y to '704' '4' '350', by refer'847' '4' '251' '301' to '530' Heaven, '69' f'34' to casting '202's, to '66' '17' '94'se ca'364' '14' '164' tempest '28' upon '116'. The '202' is Jonah's; '7' disc'118'ed, '98' '60' furiously '69' mob '58' '31' '238' '681'. 'What is thine occupation? Whence '67'st thou? Thy '893'ry? What '151'? But mark '56', my shipmates, '4' behavior of '719' Jonah. The eager mariners '33' '257' '58' '94' he is, '6' w'43' '83'; w'43'as, '69' '23' '146' receive an '491' to '200' '681', '33' '46'wise an'173' '491' to a '455' '23' '186' by '116', '33' '4' unsolicited '491' is '17'ced '83' Jonah by '4' '321' h'6' of God '7' is upon '58'.
"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries—'6' '98'—'I fear '4' Lord '4' God of Heaven '94' hath '721'e '4' sea '6' '4' dry l'6'!' Fear '58', O Jonah? Aye, '35' '240'est thou fear '4' Lord God '98'! Straight'103', he '56' '547' on to '106' a '597' confession; w'43'upon '4' mariners be'246' '117' '6' '117' app'34'ed, '33' s'773' '36' pitiful. For '74' Jonah, '23' '332' supplicating God '17' mercy, '317' he '33' '111' '35' k'212' '4' '967'ness of '90' deserts,—'74' wretched Jonah cries '44' to '116' to '101' '58' '6' cast '58' '17'th '155' '4' sea, '17' he k'212' '7' '17' '90' '997' '14' '164' tempest '28' upon '116'; '69' merci'597'y '391' '83' '58', '6' '66'k by '173' '410' to '550' '4' ship. But '34' in vain; '4' indignant gale '60'ls louder; '98', '31' '63' h'6' raised invokingly to God, '31' '4' '173' '69' '23' unreluctantly lay '330' of Jonah.
"And '56' be'330' Jonah '645' up as an anchor '6' '705'ped '155' '4' sea; '74' instantly an oily '804'ness floats '44' '83' '4' east, '6' '4' sea is s'773', as Jonah '324'ries d'249' '4' gale '31' '58', '568' smooth '604' '528'. He '547' d'249' in '4' whirling '374' of '375' a master'759' commotion '7' he s'324'ce heeds '4' mo'508't '74' he '705's '66''124' '155' '4' yawning jaws a'483' '58'; '6' '4' whale '855's-to '34' '90' ivory teeth, '46' so '128'y '691' bolts, upon '90' '954'. Then Jonah prayed unto '4' Lord '44' of '4' fish's belly. But observe '90' prayer, '6' '819' a w'879'y '759'on. For sinful as he is, Jonah '185' '23' weep '6' wail '17' direct de'349''868'ce. He '174's '7' '90' d'504'ful punish'508't is '22'. He '224's '34' '90' de'349''868'ce to God, con'606'ting '58''968' '31' '14', '7' spite of '34' '90' '684's '6' pangs, he '76' s'773' '73' to'869'ds His holy temple. And '43', shipmates, is '354' '6' faithful repentance; '23' clamorous '17' pardon, '33' grateful '17' punish'508't. And '60' pleasing to God '28' '14' conduct in Jonah, is s'60'n in '4' '140'tual de'349''868'ce of '58' '83' '4' sea '6' '4' whale. Shipmates, I do '23' '226' Jonah '165' '1' to be copied '17' '90' sin '33' I do '226' '58' '165' '1' as a model '17' repentance. Sin '23'; '33' if '1' do, '101' heed to repent of it '46' Jonah."
While he '28' '613'ing '182' '429's, '4' '60'ling of '4' shrieking, slanting storm '327' '562'ed to add '212' '637' to '4' pr'356'er, '94', '74' describing Jonah's sea-storm, '562'ed tossed by a storm '58''968'. His deep chest heaved as '31' a ground-s'35'; '90' tossed arms '562'ed '4' '869''847' ele'508'ts at '176'; '6' '4' th'447's '7' rolled '170' '83' '141' '90' s'869'thy brow, '6' '4' '703' leaping '83' '90' '784', '721'e '34' '90' '910' he'36'rs '73' on '58' '31' a quick fear '7' '28' st'868'ge to '116'.
T'43' '56' '246' a lull in '90' '73', as he silently '391'ed '118' '4' '224's of '4' Book '336' '117'; '6', at '181', st'6'ing motion'759', '31' '452'd '495', '17' '4' mo'508't, '562'ed communing '31' God '6' '58''968'.
But '158' he leaned '118' to'869'ds '4' '151', '6' bo'768'g '90' '342' lowly, '31' an aspect of '4' deepest '332' '128''596'st humility, he spake '182' '429's:
"Shipmates, God '129' laid '33' '63' h'6' upon '1'; '312' '90' '524' press upon me. I '19' '504' ye by '11' murky '703' '289' be '462' '4' '759'on '7' Jonah t'356'es to '34' sinners; '6' t'43''17'e to ye, '6' s'773' '117' to me, '17' I am a '164'er sinner '169' ye. And '56' '60' '431'ly '72' I '67' d'249' '83' '14' mast-'342' '6' '421' on '4' hatches t'43' w'43' '1' '421', '6' '919'en as '1' '919'en, '313' '96' '63' of '1' '504's me '7' '173' '6' '117' awful '759'on '265' Jonah t'356'es to me, as a pi'202' of '4' '565' God. How '213' an anointed pi'202'-prophet, or '613'er of '354' '124's, '6' bidden by '4' Lord to '602' '200' unwel'67' '350's in '4' ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, app'34'ed at '4' hostility he '134' raise, fled '83' '90' '376'ion, '6' sought to escape '90' duty '6' '90' God by '409' ship at Joppa. But God is e'131'w'43'; Tars'90'h he n'167' r'356'ed. As we '19' '333', God '246' upon '58' in '4' whale, '6' sw'34''969'd '58' d'249' to '565' gulfs of doom, '6' '31' swift slantings tore '58' '549' ''155' '4' midst of '4' seas,' w'43' '4' eddying depths sucked '58' '606' thous'6' fathoms d'249', '6' ''4' weeds '85' wrapped '39' '90' '342',' '6' '34' '4' '604'y '296' of woe bowled '118' '58'. Yet '140' '98' beyond '4' r'356' of '138' plum'559'—''44' of '4' belly of '245''—'74' '4' whale grounded upon '4' ocean's ut'344' b'913', '140' '98', God '299' '4' engulphed, repenting prophet '74' he cried. Then God spake unto '4' fish; '6' '83' '4' shudde'847' '690' '6' '751'ness of '4' sea, '4' whale '246' breeching up to'869'ds '4' '869'm '6' pleasant sun, '6' '34' '4' de'703's of '769' '6' '987'; '6' 'vomited '44' Jonah upon '4' dry l'6';' '74' '4' '429' of '4' Lord '246' a '347' '75'; '6' Jonah, bruised '6' bea'606'—'90' ears, '46' '149' sea-s'245's, s'773' multitudinously murmu'847' of '4' ocean—Jonah '64' '4' Al'240'y's bidding. And '11' '28' '7', shipmates? To pr'356' '4' Truth to '4' '352' of Falsehood! That '28' it!
"T'90', shipmates, '14' is '7' '173' '759'on; '6' woe to '7' pi'202' of '4' '565' God '94' s'703's it. Woe to '58' '94'm '14' '296' charms '83' Gospel duty!

He '705'ped '6' '947' '170' '83' '58''968' '17' a mo'508't; '98' lifting '90' '352' to '116' '158', s'60'ed a deep joy in '90' '495', as he cried '44' '31' a heavenly enthusiasm,—"But oh! shipmates! on '4' starboard h'6' of e'131' woe, t'43' is a '115' de'703'; '6' '530'er '4' '739' of '7' de'703', '169' '4' bottom of '4' woe is deep.

He '136' no '117', '33' slowly waving a benediction, c'118'ed '90' '352' '31' '90' '524', '6' so remained kneeling, '773' '34' '4' '151' '97' de'348'ed, '6' he '28' '269' al'63' in '4' '226'.




CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Fri'398'.

Re'391'ing to '4' Sp'44'er-Inn '83' '4' Chapel, I '295' Queequeg t'43' '538' al'63'; he '305' '269' '4' Chapel '165' '4' benediction '96' '75'. He '28' '812' on a bench '165' '4' '522', '31' '90' '908' on '4' stove '374'h, '6' in '63' h'6' '28' '956' '452' up to '90' '352' '7' '105' negro idol of '90'; pee'847' '321' '155' '716' '352', '6' '31' a jack-knife gently w'479'tling '170' at '716' nose, '80''313' humming to '58''968' in '90' hea'98'ish '103'.
But '213' '56' interrupted, he '186' up '4' image; '6' '281' '358', '45' to '4' t'473', '111'k up a large '560' t'43', '6' placing it on '90' lap began '893'ing '4' pages '31' deliberate regularity; at e'131' fiftieth page—as I fancied—'188'ping a mo'508't, '262' va'51'tly '187' '58', '6' '631' utte'868'ce to a '192'-drawn gurgling w'90'tle of astonish'508't. He '72' '98' begin '158' at '4' '290' fifty; '562'ing to com'508'ce at '539' '63' '356' '75', as '463' he '87' '23' '893' '117' '169' fifty, '6' it '28' '146' by '375' a large '539' of fifties '213' '295' to'42''49', '7' '90' astonish'508't at '4' multitude of pages '28' excited.
With '137' inte'426' I sat '763' '58'. Savage '463' he '28', '6' hideously mar'796' '39' '4' '352'—at '402' to my taste—'90' coun'606'ance '332' '97' a so'559'hing in it '265' '28' by no '410' dis'897''473'. You '51''23' hide '4' soul. Through '34' '90' un'987'ly tat'111'ings, I '147' I '282' '4' traces of a '910' h'913't '374'; '6' in '90' large, deep '495', fiery '751' '6' b'261', t'43' '562'ed tokens of a spirit '7' '72' d'36' a thous'6' d'779's. And be'500's '34' '14', t'43' '28' a '979' lofty bea'847' '39' '4' Pagan, '265' '140' '90' unc'44'hness '87' '23' alto'42''49' maim. He '720' '46' a '128' '94' '97' n'167' c'847'ed '6' n'167' '97' '97' a c'796'itor. Whe'4'r it '28', '111', '7' '90' '342' '213' s'19'd, '90' '17'e'342' '28' drawn '44' in '523'r '6' b'40'er re'596'f, '6' '720' '117' expansive '169' it '173'wise '72', '14' I '76' '23' venture to decide; '33' '979' it '28' '90' '342' '28' phrenologic'34'y an excellent '63'. It '289' '562' ridiculous, '33' it re'241'ed me of General Washington's '342', as '333' in '4' popular busts of '58'. It '97' '4' '276' '192' regularly graded retr'545'ing slope '83' above '4' brows, '265' '85' '46'wise '131' projecting, '46' '149' '192' promontories thickly wooded on '739'. Queequeg '28' '791' Washington '51'niba'919'ic'34'y developed.
Whilst I '28' thus '452'ly s'51'ning '58', '499'-pre'606'ding '80''313' to be '262' '44' at '4' storm '83' '4' '390''508't, he n'167' heeded my presence, n'167' '461'd '58''968' '31' so '137' as a single glance; '33' appea'796' '94'lly occupied '31' '893'ing '4' pages of '4' marvellous '560'. Con'500''847' '60' sociably we '97' '91' '503'ing to'42''49' '4' '168' previous, '6' especi'34'y con'500''847' '4' affectionate arm I '97' '295' '687'n '118' me upon waking in '4' '339', I '147' '14' indifference of '90' '131' st'868'ge. But savages '36' st'868'ge '213's; at '464' '1' do '23' k'56' '304' '60' to '101' '116'. At '171' '69' '36' '118'a'768'g; '238' '804' '968'-collectedness of simpli'709' '562's a Socratic wisdom. I '97' '23''972'd '516' '7' Queequeg n'167' con'563'ed at '34', or '33' '131' '105', '31' '4' '173' sea'508' in '4' inn. He '721'e no advances w'413'ver; appea'796' to '19' no de'284'e to enlarge '4' circle of '90' acquaintances. All '14' struck me as '240'y singular; '332', upon '347' '147's, t'43' '28' so'559'hing al'344' sublime in it. Here '28' a '128' '96' t'277'y thous'6' miles '83' '179', by '4' '103' of Cape Horn, '7' is—'265' '28' '4' '146' '103' he '87' '42' t'43'—'687'n among '151' as st'868'ge to '58' as '463' he '85' in '4' '519'et Jupiter; '6' '332' he '562'ed '797'ly at '90' ease; preserving '4' ut'344' serenity; con'606't '31' '90' '249' companionship; '194' equal to '58''968'. Surely '14' '28' a '678' of '178' philosophy; '463' no doubt he '97' n'167' '299' t'43' '28' '375' a '124' as '7'. But, '760', to be '354' philosop'49's, we mortals '134' '23' be conscious of so '565' or so striving. So '358' as I '230' '7' '375' or '375' a '128' '145's '58''968' '44' '17' a philosop'49', I conclude '7', '46' '4' dyspeptic '261' '263', he '259' '19' "'785'n '90' digester."
As I sat t'43' in '7' '56' l'63'ly '267'; '4' '522' burning low, in '7' mild stage '74', '180' '716' '171' in'606''421'y '129' '869'med '4' '769', it '98' '146' glows to be '720' at; '4' '140'ing s'97'es '6' phantoms ga'4''847' round '4' '390''508'ts, '6' pee'847' in upon us silent, solitary twain; '4' storm booming '327' in solemn s'35's; I began to be sensible of st'868'ge '699'. I '577' a melting in me. No '117' my splinte'796' '374' '6' '721'dened h'6' '85' '391'ed '485' '4' wolfish '296'. T'90' soo'124' savage '97' '796'eemed it. T'43' he sat, '90' '131' indifference '613'ing a nature in '265' t'43' lurked no civilized hypocrisies '6' bl'6' dece'716'. Wild he '28'; a '131' sight of sights to '66'; '332' I began to '174' '302' mysteriously drawn to'869'ds '58'. And '200' '276' '124's '7' '72' '19' repelled '344' '173's, '69' '85' '4' '131' magnets '7' thus drew me. '82' '244' a pagan fri'398', '147' I, '317' '917'tian '207'ness '129' '831'd '33' hollow c'119'tesy. I drew my bench '958' '58', '6' '721'e '96' fri'398'ly '659's '6' hints, '143' my '258' to '150' '31' '58' '80''313'. At '171' he '105' '23''972'd '182' advances; '33' '986'ly, upon my refer'847' to '90' '181' '168''s '467'ities, he '721'e '44' to '257' me whe'4'r we '85' '158' to be '515''947'ows. I '163' '58' '89'; w'43'at I '147' he '720' '142'd, '760' a '105' compli'508'ted.
We '98' '391'ed '118' '4' '560' to'42''49', '6' I '398'eavo'796' to '656' to '58' '4' purpose of '4' printing, '6' '4' '80'ing of '4' '360' '648's '7' '85' in it. Thus I '358' engaged '90' inte'426'; '6' '83' '7' we '277' to jabbe'847' '4' '258' we '87' '39' '4' various '44'er sights to be '333' in '14' famous t'249'. Soon I proposed a social smoke; '6', producing '90' pouch '6' tomahawk, he '935'ly '141'e'796' me a puff. And '98' we sat exc'621'ing puffs '83' '7' wild pipe of '90', '6' '184'ing it regularly '962'ing '592'ween us.
If t'43' '332' lurked '138' '972' of indifference to'869'ds me in '4' Pagan's breast, '14' pleasant, genial smoke we '97', '358' thawed it '44', '6' '269' us cronies. He '562'ed to '101' to me '538' as natur'34'y '6' unbiddenly as I to '58'; '6' '74' '119' smoke '28' '118', he pressed '90' '17'e'342' '485' '462', clasped me round '4' waist, '6' '136' '7' hence'17'th we '85' '377'; '80'ing, in '90' '893'ry's phrase, '7' we '85' bosom fri'398's; he '72' '431'ly '474' '17' me, if '107' '134' be. In a '893'ry'128', '14' sudden flame of fri'398'ship '72' '19' '562'ed '458' '111' premature, a '124' to be '137' dis'395'ed; '33' in '14' '910' savage '200' '261' rules '72' '23' apply.
After supper, '6' an'173' social chat '6' smoke, we '277' to '119' '267' to'42''49'. He '721'e me a '986' of '90' embalmed '342'; '111'k '44' '90' enormous tobacco w'34'et, '6' groping '447' '4' tobacco, drew '44' '96' thirty '788' in silver; '98' sp'504'ing '116' on '4' t'473', '6' mechanic'34'y dividing '116' '155' '149' equal portions, pu'50'd '63' of '116' to'869'ds me, '6' '136' it '28' '462'. I '28' '45' to remonstrate; '33' he silenced me by p'119'ing '116' '155' my trowsers' pockets. I '123' '116' '235'. He '98' '277' '39' '90' '140'ing prayers, '111'k '44' '90' idol, '6' re'367'd '4' '888' '522'board. By '979' '659's '6' symptoms, I '147' he '562'ed anxious '17' me to join '58'; '33' '35' kno'768'g '11' '28' to '858', I deliberated a mo'508't whe'4'r, in '390' he invited me, I '72' comply or '173'wise.
I '28' a '68' '917'tian; born '6' b'796' in '4' bosom of '4' inf'34'ible Presbyterian Church. How '98' '87' I unite '31' '14' wild idolator in worshipping '90' '747' of wood? But '11' is worship? '147' I. Do '1' '803' '56', Ishmael, '7' '4' magnanimous God of heaven '6' '987'—pagans '6' '34' included—'51' '999' be jealous of an in'659'ifi'51't '437' of '751' wood? Im'622'! But '11' is worship?—to do '4' '76' of God—'7' is worship. And '11' is '4' '76' of God?—to do to my '947'ow '128' '11' I '72' '19' my '947'ow '128' to do to me—'7' is '4' '76' of God. Now, Queequeg is my '947'ow '128'. And '11' do I '392' '7' '14' Queequeg '72' do to me? Why, unite '31' me in my '348'icular Presbyterian '17'm of worship. Consequently, I '259' '98' unite '31' '58' in '90'; ergo, I '259' '391' idolator. So I '207'led '4' s'305's; '148'ed prop up '4' innocent '105' idol; '141'e'796' '58' burnt biscuit '31' Queequeg; salamed '165' '58' tw'972' or thr'972'; '679'ed '90' nose; '6' '7' d'63', we un'926'ed '6' '277' to '515', at peace '31' '119' '249' consciences '6' '34' '4' '296'. But we '64' '23' go to '503' '327' '96' '105' chat.
How it is I k'56' '23'; '33' t'43' is no '226' '46' a '515' '17' confidential disclo'115's '592'ween fri'398's. Man '6' '362', '69' '99', t'43' '422' '4' '131' bottom of '238' souls to '356' '173'; '6' '96' '261' '438's of'606' '596' '6' chat '118' '261' '464' '773' '958'ly '339'. Thus, '98', in '119' '374's' '300'moon, lay I '6' Queequeg—a cosy, loving p'769'.




CHAPTER 11. Nightg'249'.

We '97' lain thus in '515', chatting '6' napping at '940' intervals, '6' Queequeg '56' '6' '98' affectionately thro'768'g '90' br'249' tat'111'ed legs '118' '462', '6' '98' dra'768'g '116' '78'; so '797'ly soci'473' '6' '523' '6' '454' '85' we; '74', at '181', by '385' of '119' confabulations, '11' '105' nappishness remained in us alto'42''49' de'348'ed, '6' we '577' '46' '42'ting up '158', '463' '183'-'448' '28' '332' '96' '103' d'249' '4' '670'.
Yes, we be'246' '131' '830'ful; so '137' so '7' '119' recumbent po'421'ion began to grow '854'i'96', '6' by '105' '6' '105' we '295' '119'selves '812' up; '4' '945' '35' tucked '187' us, leaning '485' '4' '342'-board '31' '119' '492' knees drawn up '452' to'42''49', '6' '119' '149' noses b'398'ing '118' '116', as if '119' kneepans '85' '869'ming-pans. We '577' '131' n'972' '6' snug, '4' '117' so '317' it '28' so chilly '44' of '450's; indeed '44' of '515'-'945' '111', '66'ing '7' t'43' '28' no '522' in '4' '267'. The '117' so, I '99', beca'364' truly to '932' bodily '869'mth, '96' sm'34' '348' of '1' '259' be '690', '17' t'43' is no quality in '14' '296' '7' is '23' '11' it is merely by contrast. No'124' exists in '716'elf. If '1' flatter y'119''968' '7' '1' '36' '34' '118' com'17't'473', '6' '19' '91' so a '192' '75', '98' '1' '51''23' be '136' to be com'17't'473' '138' '117'. But if, '46' Queequeg '6' me in '4' '515', '4' tip of y'119' nose or '4' cr'249' of y'119' '342' be s'703'ly chilled, '65' '98', indeed, in '4' general consciousness '1' '174' '344' de'703''597'y '6' unmistakably '869'm. For '14' '385' a '503'ing '814' '134' n'167' be furni'50'd '31' a '522', '265' is '63' of '4' luxurious discom'17'ts of '4' rich. For '4' h'879' of '14' '563' of deliciousness is to '19' no'124' '33' '4' blanket '592'ween '1' '6' y'119' snugness '6' '4' '690' of '4' '44'er '769'. Then t'43' '1' '596' '46' '4' '63' '869'm spark in '4' '374' of an arctic crystal.
We '97' '91' '812' in '14' crouching '128'ner '17' '96' '75', '74' '34' at '336' I '147' I '72' '422' my '495'; '17' '74' '592'ween '50'ets, whe'4'r by '183' or by '168', '6' whe'4'r a'503' or a'830', I '19' a '103' of '194' '184'ing my '495' '472', in '619' '4' '117' to c'336'ntrate '4' snugness of '213' in '515'. Beca'364' no '128' '51' '167' '174' '90' '249' identity a'40' '722' '90' '495' be '452'd; as if '967'ness '85' indeed '4' proper ele'508't of '119' essences, '463' '703' be '117' congenial to '119' clayey '348'. Upon '422'ing my '495' '98', '6' '260' '44' of my '249' pleasant '6' '968'-cr'545'ed '967'ness '155' '4' imposed '6' coarse '44'er gloom of '4' unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-'168', I experienced a dis'897''473' revulsion. Nor '64' I at '34' object to '4' hint '83' Queequeg '7' '760' it '85' '258' to strike a '703', '66'ing '7' we '85' so wide a'830'; '6' be'500's he '577' a '777' de'284'e to '19' a '360' '935' puffs '83' '90' Tomahawk. Be it '136', '7' '463' I '97' '577' '375' a '777' repugnance to '90' smoking in '4' '515' '4' '168' '165', '332' '66' '60' e'181'ic '119' stiff prejud'972's grow '74' '112' '336' '67's to b'398' '116'. For '56' I '46'd no'124' '166' '169' to '19' Queequeg smoking by me, '140' in '515', beca'364' he '562'ed to be '597' of '375' serene ho'364''330' joy '98'. I no '117' '577' unduly '936' '17' '4' l'6'lord's policy of insu'868'ce. I '28' '146' a'349' to '4' condensed confidential com'17't'473'ness of sha'847' a pipe '6' a blanket '31' a '272' fri'398'. With '119' shaggy jackets drawn '39' '119' '134'ers, we '56' '962'ed '4' Tomahawk '83' '63' to '4' '173', '773' slowly t'43' grew '118' us a blue '621'ing '704'er of smoke, illuminated by '4' flame of '4' '212'-lit lamp.
Whe'4'r it '28' '7' '14' undulating '704'er rolled '4' savage '170' to '458' distant scenes, I k'56' '23', '33' he '56' spoke of '90' native isl'6'; '6', eager to '230' '90' '903', I begged '58' to go on '6' '81' it. He '431'ly comp'596'd. Though at '4' '75' I '33' ill compreh'398'ed '23' a '360' of '90' '429's, '332' subsequent disclo'115's, '74' I '97' be'67' '117' familiar '31' '90' '785'n phraseology, '56' en'473' me to '986' '4' '251' '480' '375' as it '289' '831' in '4' mere ske'123'on I '145'.




CHAPTER 12. Biographical.

Queequeg '28' a native of Rokovoko, an isl'6' '458' '170' to '4' West '6' S'44'h. It is '23' d'249' in '138' map; '354' '226's n'167' '36'.
When a '212'-hatched savage '573' wild '39' '90' native woodl'6's in a gr'652' cl'44', '858'ed by '4' nibbling goats, as if he '85' a green sapling; '140' '98', in Queequeg's am'437'ious soul, lurked a '777' de'284'e to '66' so'559'hing '117' of '917''606'dom '169' a speci'508' whaler or '149'. His '233' '28' a High Chief, a King; '90' uncle a High Priest; '6' on '4' maternal '500' he boasted '976's '94' '85' '4' wives of unconquer'473' '869'riors. T'43' '28' excellent '593' in '90' veins—royal '343'; '463' sadly vitiated, I fear, by '4' '51'nibal pr'422''421'y he n'119'i'50'd in '90' untuto'796' '1'th.
A Sag Harbor ship vi'421'ed '90' '233''s bay, '6' Queequeg sought a '962'age to '917'tian l'6's. But '4' ship, '305' '49' '597' comple'508't of sea'508', spurned '90' suit; '6' '23' '34' '4' King '90' '233''s influence '87' prevail. But Queequeg v'969'd a vow. Al'63' in '90' '51'oe, he paddled '141' to a distant strait, '265' he k'212' '4' ship '259' '962' '209' '74' '50' quitted '4' isl'6'. On '63' '500' '28' a coral reef; on '4' '173' a low tongue of l'6', c'118'ed '31' '128'grove thickets '7' grew '44' '155' '4' '604'. Hiding '90' '51'oe, s'773' afloat, among '182' thickets, '31' '716' prow sea'869'd, he sat d'249' in '4' stern, paddle low in h'6'; '6' '74' '4' ship '28' gliding by, '46' a flash he darted '44'; gained '49' '500'; '31' '63' '78''869'd dash of '90' foot capsized '6' sank '90' '51'oe; clim'515' up '4' chains; '6' thro'768'g '58''968' at '597' length upon '4' deck, grappled a '847'-bolt t'43', '6' swore '23' to '123' it go, '463' hacked in '747's.
In vain '4' captain threa'606'ed to '687' '58' '118'board; susp'398'ed a '537'l'652' '118' '90' naked wrists; Queequeg '28' '4' '273' of a King, '6' Queequeg budged '23'. Struck by '90' desperate d'976''759'ness, '6' '90' wild de'284'e to vi'421' '917''606'dom, '4' captain at '181' relented, '6' '163' '58' he '240' '106' '58''968' at '179'. But '14' '178' '507' savage—'14' sea Prince of Wales, n'167' '282' '4' Captain's cabin. T'84' '186' '58' d'249' among '4' sailors, '6' '721'e a whale'128' of '58'. But '46' Czar Peter con'606't to toil in '4' shipyards of '17'eign cities, Queequeg disdained no '562'ing ignominy, if t'43'by he '240' happily gain '4' '637' of enligh'606'ing '90' untuto'796' '893'ry'508'. For at bottom—so he '163' me—he '28' '735'uated by a pro'295' de'284'e to '819' among '4' '917'tians, '4' arts w'43'by to '106' '90' '151' s'773' happier '169' '69' '85'; '6' '117' '169' '7', s'773' '166' '169' '69' '85'. But, alas! '4' pr'735''972's of whale'508' '358' convinced '58' '7' '140' '917'tians '87' be '312' miser'473' '6' wicked; infinitely '117' so, '169' '34' '90' '233''s hea'98's. Arrived at '181' in '261' Sag Harbor; '6' '66'ing '11' '4' sailors '64' t'43'; '6' '98' '45' on to Nantucket, '6' '66'ing '60' '69' '953' '238' wages in '7' '226' '516', '719' Queequeg '417' it up '17' '387'. Thought he, '30' a wicked '296' in '34' meridians; '82' '474' a pagan.
And thus an '261' idolator at '374', he '332' '349'd among '182' '917'tians, wore '238' '945', '6' '457' to '150' '238' gibberish. Hence '4' queer '103's '39' '58', '463' '56' '96' '75' '83' '179'.
By hints, I '257'ed '58' whe'4'r he '64' '23' propose '45' '78', '6' '305' a coronation; '317' he '240' '56' con'500'r '90' '233' '314' '6' g'63', he '213' '131' '261' '6' feeble at '4' '181' ac'893's. He '491'ed no, '23' '332'; '6' added '7' he '28' fearful '917'tianity, or '743' '917'tians, '97' unfitted '58' '17' asc'398'ing '4' pure '6' undefiled thr'63' of thirty pagan Kings '165' '58'. But by '6' by, he '136', he '72' re'391',—as '358' as he '577' '58''968' baptized '158'. For '4' n'336', '60''167', he proposed to sail '39', '6' sow '90' wild oats in '34' '492' oceans. T'84' '97' '721'e a harpo'63'er of '58', '6' '7' '960''515' iron '28' in '596'u of a sceptre '56'.
I '257'ed '58' '11' '240' be '90' immediate purpose, '678'ing '90' '670' '367''508'ts. He '491'ed, to go to sea '158', in '90' '261' vocation.

CHAPTER 13. Wheel'960'row.

Next '339', Mon'183', '180' disposing of '4' embalmed '342' to a '960'ber, '17' a block, I '451'tled my '249' '6' comrade's '899'; '970', '60''167', my comrade's m'63'y. The grinning l'6'lord, as '35' as '4' boarders, '562'ed '738'ly tickled at '4' sudden fri'398'ship '265' '97' sp'366'g up '592'ween me '6' Queequeg—especi'34'y as Peter C'141'in's cock '6' bull stories '39' '58' '97' previously so '137' alarmed me c'336'rning '4' '131' '369' '94'm I '56' companied '31'.
We borr'969'd a wheel'960'row, '6' em'960'king '119' '124's, including my '249' '719' '324'pet-bag, '6' Queequeg's '51'vas sack '6' hammock, '170' we '277' d'249' to "'4' Moss," '4' '105' Nantucket packet scho'63'r moo'796' at '4' wharf. As we '85' '45' '549' '4' '151' sta'796'; '23' at Queequeg so '137'—'17' '69' '85' '364'd to '66'ing '51'nibals '46' '58' in '238' '811's,—'33' at '66'ing '58' '6' me upon '375' confidential terms. But we heeded '116' '23', '45' '549' wheeling '4' '960'row by '391's, '6' Queequeg '56' '6' '98' '188'ping to ad'22' '4' '50'ath on '90' harpoon '960'bs. I '257'ed '58' '65' he '324'ried '375' a '461''96' '124' '31' '58' ashore, '6' whe'4'r '34' whaling ships '64' '23' '156' '238' '249' harpoons. To '14', in substance, he rep'596'd, '7' '463' '11' I hinted '28' '354' '243', '332' he '97' a '348'icular affection '17' '90' '249' harpoon, beca'364' it '28' of '652'u'796' '343', '35' '457' in '128'y a mortal combat, '6' deeply intimate '31' '4' '374's of whales. In '940', '46' '128'y inl'6' reapers '6' m'969'rs, '94' go '155' '4' '458'mers' meadows armed '31' '238' '249' scy'4's—'463' in no wise obliged to furnish '116'—'140' so, Queequeg, '17' '90' '249' '988' '385's, prefer'796' '90' '249' harpoon.
Shifting '4' '960'row '83' my h'6' to '90', he '163' me a '427'ny '480' '39' '4' '171' wheel'960'row he '97' '167' '333'. It '28' in Sag Harbor. The '249'ers of '90' ship, it '562's, '97' lent '58' '63', in '265' to '324'ry '90' heavy chest to '90' boarding ho'364'. Not to '562' igno'868't '39' '4' '124'—'463' in '350' he '28' '797'ly so, c'336'rning '4' precise '103' in '265' to '128'age '4' '960'row—Queequeg '186's '90' chest upon it; la'50's it '692'; '6' '98' '134'ers '4' '960'row '6' marches up '4' wharf. "Why," '136' I, "Queequeg, '1' '240' '19' '677' '166' '169' '7', '63' '72' '54'. Didn't '4' '151' laugh?"
Upon '14', he '163' me an'173' '480'. The '151' of '90' isl'6' of Rokovoko, it '562's, at '238' '471' feasts express '4' frag'868't '604' of '507' cocoanuts '155' a large stained calabash '46' a punchbowl; '6' '14' punchbowl '194' '17'ms '4' '164' central orna'508't on '4' braided mat w'43' '4' feast is held. Now a '979' gr'6' merchant ship '336' '678'ed at Rokovoko, '6' '716' com'128'der—'83' '34' ac'893's, a '131' '892'ly punctilious gentle'128', at '402' '17' a sea captain—'14' com'128'der '28' invited to '4' '471' feast of Queequeg's '434', a '281' '507' princess '22' '391'ed of '606'. Well; '74' '34' '4' '471' guests '85' '652'514'bled at '4' b'852''s bamboo cottage, '14' Captain marches in, '6' '213' as'659'ed '4' post of hon'119', '226'd '58''968' '118' '485' '4' punchbowl, '6' '592'ween '4' High Priest '6' '90' majesty '4' King, Queequeg's '233'. '689' '213' '136',—'17' '200' '151' '19' '238' grace as '35' as we—'463' Queequeg '163' me '7' un'46' us, '94' at '375' '464' '73' d'249''869'ds to '119' platters, '69', on '4' contrary, copying '4' ducks, glance up'869'ds to '4' '164' Giver of '34' feasts—'689', I '99', '213' '136', '4' High Priest '422's '4' banquet by '4' immemorial ceremony of '4' isl'6'; '7' is, dipping '90' consecrated '6' consecrating fingers '155' '4' bowl '165' '4' b'759'ed b'167'age circu'399's. Seeing '58''968' '226'd '290' '4' Priest, '6' '23'ing '4' ceremony, '6' '54'ing '58''968'—'213' Captain of a ship—as '305' plain precedence '118' a mere isl'6' King, especi'34'y in '4' King's '249' ho'364'—'4' Captain '494'ly proceeds to '28'h '90' '524' in '4' punchbowl;—'409' it I '803' '17' a huge finger-gl'652'. "Now," '136' Queequeg, "'11' '1' tink '56'?—Didn't '119' '151' laugh?"
At '181', '962'age paid, '6' luggage '564', we s'111'd on board '4' scho'63'r. Hoisting sail, it glided d'249' '4' Acushnet river. On '63' '500', New Bed'17'd rose in terraces of '811's, '238' '972'-c'118'ed trees '34' glitte'847' in '4' '574', '690' '769'. Huge hills '6' mountains of c'257's on c'257's '85' piled upon '49' wharves, '6' '500' by '500' '4' '296'-w'6'e'847' whale ships lay silent '6' '564'ly moo'796' at '181'; '313' '83' '173's '246' a '602' of '324'penters '6' coopers, '31' bl'398'ed noises of '522's '6' '17'ges to melt '4' pitch, '34' '592'okening '7' '212' cruises '85' on '4' '319'; '7' '63' '344' perilous '6' '192' voyage '398'ed, '146' begins a '347'; '6' a '347' '398'ed, '146' begins a third, '6' so on, '17' '167' '6' '17' aye. Such is '4' '398''759'ness, yea, '4' '155'ler'473'ness of '34' '987'ly ef'17't.
Gaining '4' '117' '422' '604', '4' bracing breeze waxed fresh; '4' '105' Moss tossed '4' quick foam '83' '49' bows, as a '507' colt '90' snortings. How I snuffed '7' Tartar '769'!—'60' I spurned '7' '391'pike '987'!—'7' common '530''103' '34' '118' dented '31' '4' marks of slavish heels '6' hoofs; '6' '391'ed me to admire '4' magnanimity of '4' sea '265' '76' permit no records.
At '4' '276' foam-fountain, Queequeg '562'ed to '580' '6' reel '31' me. His dusky nostrils s'35'ed a'348'; he s'60'ed '90' filed '6' '378'ed teeth. On, on we flew; '6' '119' '141'ing gained, '4' Moss '64' homage to '4' b'181'; ducked '6' dived '49' bows as a slave '165' '4' Sultan. Side'103's leaning, we '500''103's darted; e'131' ropeyarn tingling '46' a wire; '4' '149' t'34' masts buckling '46' Indian '51'es in l'6' torna'185'. So '597' of '14' reeling scene '85' we, as we s'111'd by '4' plunging bowsprit, '7' '17' '96' '75' we '64' '23' '23''972' '4' jee'847' glances of '4' '962'engers, a lubber-'46' '652'514'bly, '94' marvelled '7' '149' '947'ow '213's '134' be so companion'473'; as '463' a '691' '128' '85' '138''124' '117' dignified '169' a '691'wa'50'd negro. But t'43' '85' '96' boobies '6' bumpkins t'43', '94', by '238' in'606'se greenness, '259' '19' '67' '83' '4' '374' '6' centre of '34' verdure. Queequeg '808' '63' of '182' '507' saplings mimicking '58' '528' '90' '78'. I '147' '4' bumpkin's '612' of doom '28' '67'. Dropping '90' harpoon, '4' brawny savage '808' '58' in '90' arms, '6' by an al'344' miraculous dexterity '6' strength, '708' '58' '530' up bodily '155' '4' '769'; '98' s'703'ly tapping '90' stern in mid-'96'r'451', '4' '947'ow l'6'ed '31' bursting lungs upon '90' '908', '313' Queequeg, '391'ing '90' '78' upon '58', '703'ed '90' tomahawk pipe '6' '962'ed it to me '17' a puff.
"Capting! Capting!" yelled '4' bumpkin, '573' to'869'ds '7' '493'r; "Capting, Capting, '43''s '4' d'779'."
"H'34'o, '1' '284'," cried '4' Captain, a g'976' rib of '4' sea, s'150'ing up to Queequeg, "'11' in th'447' do '1' '80' by '7'? Don't '1' k'56' '1' '240' '19' '466' '7' chap?"
"What '58' '99'?" '136' Queequeg, as he mildly '391'ed to me.
"He '99'," '136' I, "'7' '1' '246' '958' '320'-e '7' '128' t'43'," '378'ing to '4' s'773' shive'847' greenhorn.
"Kill-e," cried Queequeg, twisting '90' tat'111'ed '352' '155' an un'987'ly expression of disdain, "ah! '58' bevy sm'34'-e fish-e; Queequeg no '320'-e so sm'34'-e fish-e; Queequeg '320'-e '201' whale!"
"Look '1'," roa'796' '4' Captain, "'82' '320'-e '1', '1' '51'nibal, if '1' '244' '138' '117' of y'119' tricks aboard '43'; so '241' y'119' '784'."
But it so '203' '22' '98', '7' it '28' '530' '75' '17' '4' Captain to '241' '90' '249' '784'. The prodigious strain upon '4' main-sail '97' '348'ed '4' wea'4'r-'50'et, '6' '4' tre'508'dous boom '28' '56' f'666' '83' '500' to '500', comp'123'ely sweeping '4' '797' '180' '348' of '4' deck. The '719' '947'ow '94'm Queequeg '97' '627'd so roughly, '28' swept '118'board; '34' '524' '85' in a panic; '6' to attempt snatching at '4' boom to '235' it, '562'ed '721'ness. It flew '83' '40' to '269', '6' '78' '158', al'344' in '63' ticking of a '430', '6' e'131' instant '562'ed on '4' '378' of snapping '155' splinters. No'124' '28' d'63', '6' no'124' '562'ed cap'473' of '213' d'63'; '200' on deck ru'50'd to'869'ds '4' bows, '6' s'111'd '784'ing '4' boom as if it '85' '4' l'969'r jaw of an exasperated whale. In '4' midst of '14' consternation, Queequeg '705'ped deftly to '90' knees, '6' crawling '447' '4' path of '4' boom, whipped '330' of a rope, secu'796' '63' '398' to '4' bul'869'ks, '6' '98' flinging '4' '173' '46' a l'652'o, '808' it round '4' boom as it swept '118' '90' '342', '6' at '4' '290' jerk, '4' spar '28' '7' '103' trapped, '6' '34' '28' '564'. The scho'63'r '28' '366' '155' '4' '768'd, '6' '313' '4' '524' '85' clea'847' '170' '4' stern boat, Queequeg, s'798'ped to '4' waist, darted '83' '4' '500' '31' a '192' '565' arc of a leap. For '291' '294's or '117' he '28' '333' swimming '46' a '766', thro'768'g '90' '192' arms '688' '44' '165' '58', '6' by '391's revealing '90' brawny '134'ers '209' '4' '523'zing foam. I '720' at '4' gr'6' '6' glorious '947'ow, '33' '282' no '63' to be '550'd. The greenhorn '97' g'63' d'249'. Shooting '58''968' perp'398'icularly '83' '4' '604', Queequeg, '56' '111'k an instant's glance '187' '58', '6' '562'ing to '66' '22' '60' '301's '85', dived d'249' '6' disappea'796'. A '360' '294's '117', '6' he rose '158', '63' arm s'773' striking '44', '6' '31' '4' '173' dragging a '139''759' '17'm. The boat '358' '512'ed '116' up. The '719' bumpkin '28' '426'o'796'. All '524' voted Queequeg a noble trump; '4' captain begged '90' pardon. From '7' '612' I c'112' to Queequeg '46' a '960'nacle; yea, '773' '719' Queequeg '111'k '90' '181' '192' dive.
Was t'43' '167' '375' unconsciousness? He '64' '23' '562' to '54' '7' he at '34' '922'd a medal '83' '4' Hu'128'e '6' Magnanimous Societies. He '146' '257'ed '17' '604'—fresh '604'—so'559'hing to wipe '4' brine '141'; '7' d'63', he '186' on dry '945', '703'ed '90' pipe, '6' leaning '485' '4' bul'869'ks, '6' mildly '784'ing '200' '187' '58', '562'ed to be '99'ing to '58''968'—"It's a mutual, joint-stock '296', in '34' meridians. We '51'nibals '259' '148' '182' '917'tians."




CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.

No'124' '117' '203' on '4' '962'age '736'y '4' '508'tioning; so, '180' a '178' '366', we '564'ly arrived in Nantucket.
Nantucket! Take '44' y'119' map '6' '73' at it. See '11' a '272' corner of '4' '296' it occupies; '60' it st'6's t'43', '170' '141' shore, '117' l'63'ly '169' '4' Eddyst'63' '703'ho'364'. Look at it—a mere hillock, '6' elbow of s'6'; '34' b'356', '327' a '78'ground. T'43' is '117' s'6' t'43' '169' '1' '72' '364' in t'277'y '266' as a substitute '17' b'202'ting '888'. Some '544''96' wights '76' '81' '1' '7' '69' '19' to '519't weeds t'43', '69' '21' grow natur'34'y; '7' '69' import Canada '14'tles; '7' '69' '19' to '642' beyond seas '17' a spile to '188' a leak in an oil c'257'; '7' '747's of wood in Nantucket '36' '324'ried '39' '46' b'716' of '4' '354' cross in Rome; '7' '151' t'43' '519't toads'111'ls '165' '238' ho'364's, to '42' '447' '4' s'97'e in summer '75'; '7' '63' blade of gr'652' '408' an oasis, '291' blades in a '183''s '459' a pr'769'ie; '7' '69' '854' quicks'6' shoes, so'559'hing '46' Lapl'6'er s'56'-shoes; '7' '69' '36' so '472' up, belted '39', e'131' '103' in'452'd, surrounded, '6' '721'e an utter isl'6' of by '4' ocean, '7' to '238' '131' ch'769's '6' t'473's sm'34' clams '76' so'559'imes be '295' adhe'847', as to '4' '78's of sea turtles. But '182' extravaganzas '146' s'60' '7' Nantucket is no Illinois.
Look '56' at '4' wondrous traditional '480' of '60' '14' isl'6' '28' '451'tled by '4' '796'-'508'. Thus '547' '4' leg'398'. In '261'en '464' an eagle swooped d'249' upon '4' New Engl'6' coast, '6' '324'ried '141' an infant Indian in '90' talons. With loud la'508't '4' p'36'nts '282' '238' '497' borne '44' of sight '118' '4' wide '604's. T'84' resolved to '858' in '4' '276' direction. Setting '44' in '238' '51'oes, '180' a perilous '962'age '69' disc'118'ed '4' isl'6', '6' t'43' '69' '295' an empty ivory c'257'et,—'4' '719' '105' Indian's ske'123'on.
What '683', '98', '7' '182' Nantucketers, born on a b'356', '134' '101' to '4' sea '17' a '349'lihood!

And thus '19' '182' naked Nantucketers, '182' sea '49'm'716', issuing '83' '238' ant-hill in '4' sea, '118''366' '6' conque'796' '4' '604'y '296' '46' so '128'y Alex'6'ers; parcelling '44' among '116' '4' Atlantic, Pacific, '6' Indian oceans, as '4' '291' pirate '637's '64' Pol'6'.

CHAPTER 15. C'60'der.

It '28' '538' '399' in '4' '140'ing '74' '4' '105' Moss '246' snugly to anchor, '6' Queequeg '6' I '277' ashore; so we '87' at'606'd to no '355' '7' '183', at '402' '697' '33' a supper '6' a '515'. The l'6'lord of '4' Sp'44'er-Inn '97' recom'508'ded us to '90' cousin Hosea Hussey of '4' Try Pots, '94'm he '652'erted to be '4' proprietor of '63' of '4' '258' '764' '576'els in '34' Nantucket, '6' '117''118' he '97' '652'u'796' us '7' Cousin Hosea, as he c'34'ed '58', '28' famous '17' '90' c'60'ders. In '940', he plainly hinted '7' we '87' '23' '999' do '166' '169' '244' pot-'672' at '4' Try Pots. But '4' directions he '97' '145'n us '39' '184'ing a yellow w'36'ho'364' on '119' starboard h'6' '773' we '422'ed a '691' church to '4' larboard, '6' '98' '184'ing '7' on '4' larboard h'6' '773' we '721'e a corner '291' '378's to '4' starboard, '6' '7' d'63', '98' '257' '4' '171' '128' we '559' w'43' '4' '226' '28': '182' crooked directions of '90' '131' '137' puzzled us at '171', especi'34'y as, at '4' '44''451', Queequeg insisted '7' '4' yellow w'36'ho'364'—'119' '171' '378' of de'348'ure—'259' be '269' on '4' larboard h'6', w'43'as I '97' '447's'111'd Peter C'141'in to '99' it '28' on '4' starboard. How'167', by dint of '942'ing '39' a '105' in '4' '967', '6' '56' '6' '98' knocking up a peace'473' inha'437'ant to inquire '4' '103', we at '181' '246' to so'559'hing '265' t'43' '28' no mis'409'.
Two enormous wooden pots '684'ted '751', '6' susp'398'ed by '652'es' ears, swung '83' '4' cross-trees of an '261' '739'-mast, '519'ted in '569' of an '261' '450''103'. The horns of '4' cross-trees '85' '282'ed '141' on '4' '173' '500', so '7' '14' '261' '739'-mast '720' '23' a '105' '46' a g'34'ows. Perhaps I '28' '118' sen'421'ive to '375' impressions at '4' '75', '33' I '87' '23' '148' sta'847' at '14' g'34'ows '31' a vague mis'631'. A '563' of crick '28' in my neck as I gazed up to '4' '149' remaining horns; '89', '149' of '116', '63' '17' Queequeg, '6' '63' '17' me. It's ominous, '54's I. A C'141'in my Inn'184'er upon l'6'ing in my '171' whaling port; tombst'913' sta'847' at me in '4' whale'508''s chapel; '6' '43' a g'34'ows! '6' a p'769' of prodigious '751' pots '111'! Are '182' '181' thro'768'g '44' oblique hints '678'ing Tophet?
I '28' c'34'ed '83' '182' reflections by '4' sight of a freckled '263' '31' yellow h'769' '6' a yellow g'249', st'6'ing in '4' porch of '4' inn, '447' a dull '796' lamp s'768'ging t'43', '7' '720' '137' '46' an inju'796' '784', '6' '324'rying on a brisk s'690'ing '31' a '128' in a purple woollen shirt.
"Get '549' '31' ye," '136' '50' to '4' '128', "or '82' be combing ye!"
"Come on, Queequeg," '136' I, "'34' '40'. T'43''s '441' Hussey."
And so it '391'ed '44'; '197' Hosea Hussey '213' '83' '179', '33' '568' '441' Hussey '797'ly compe'606't to at'606'd to '34' '90' af'807's. Upon '380' '677' '119' de'284'es '17' a supper '6' a '515', '441' Hussey, postponing fur'4'r s'690'ing '17' '4' '986', us'43'd us '155' a '105' '267', '6' s'545'ing us at a t'473' sp'504' '31' '4' relics of a recently concluded re'536', '391'ed round to us '6' '136'—"Clam or Cod?"
"What's '7' '39' Cods, ma'am?" '136' I, '31' '137' poli'606'ess.
"Clam or Cod?" '50' rep'545'ed.
"A clam '17' supper? a '690' clam; is '7' '11' '1' '80', '441' Hussey?" '415' I, "'33' '55' a '743' '690' '6' clammy reception in '4' '768'ter '75', '594' it, '441' Hussey?"
But '213' in a '164' '906' to resume s'690'ing '4' '128' in '4' purple Shirt, '94' '28' '483' '17' it in '4' en'244', '6' '562'ing to '230' no'124' '33' '4' '429' "clam," '441' Hussey hurried to'869'ds an '422' '450' leading to '4' kitchen, '6' bawling '44' "clam '17' '149'," disappea'796'.
"Queequeg," '136' I, "do '1' '54' '7' we '51' '106' '44' a supper '17' us '312' on '63' clam?"
How'167', a '869'm savory s'851' '83' '4' kitchen served to be'596' '4' app'36'ntly cheer'759' prospect '165' us. But '74' '7' smoking c'60'der '246' in, '4' mystery '28' de'703''597'y '656'ed. Oh, '584' fri'398's! '230'ken to me. It '28' '721'e of sm'34' juicy clams, s'324'cely '201'ger '169' hazel nuts, mixed '31' pounded ship biscuit, '6' salted pork '537' up '155' '105' flakes; '4' '251' enriched '31' '33'ter, '6' plenti'597'y seas'63'd '31' pepper '6' salt. Our appetites '213' sharpened by '4' frosty voyage, '6' in '348'icular, Queequeg '66'ing '90' fav'119'ite fishing '696' '165' '58', '6' '4' c'60'der '213' sur'962'ingly excellent, we despatched it '31' '164' expedition: '74' leaning '78' a mo'508't '6' be'54'ing me of '441' Hussey's clam '6' cod announce'508't, I '147' I '72' '244' a '105' experi'508't. Stepping to '4' kitchen '450', I utte'796' '4' '429' "cod" '31' '164' emp'129'is, '6' resumed my s'545'. In a '360' mo'508'ts '4' sav'119'y s'851' '246' '17'th '158', '33' '31' a '465' flavor, '6' in '68' '75' a '178' cod-c'60'der '28' '226'd '165' us.
We resumed '355'; '6' '313' p'666' '119' spoons in '4' bowl, '54's I to '302', I '683' '56' if '14' '43' '129' '138' effect on '4' '342'? What's '7' stultifying '99'ing '39' c'60'der-'342'ed '151'? "But '73', Queequeg, '594' '7' a '349' eel in y'119' bowl? W'43''s y'119' harpoon?"
Fishiest of '34' fishy '226's '28' '4' Try Pots, '265' '35' '922'd '716' '275'; '17' '4' pots t'43' '85' '194' boiling c'60'ders. C'60'der '17' '448''692', '6' c'60'der '17' '484', '6' c'60'der '17' supper, '773' '1' began to '73' '17' fish-b'913' '260' '209' y'119' '945'. The '36'a '165' '4' ho'364' '28' paved '31' clam-s'245's. '441' Hussey wore a poli'50'd necklace of codfish vertebra; '6' Hosea Hussey '97' '90' ac'893' '560's bound in superior '261' shark-skin. T'43' '28' a fishy flavor to '4' milk, '111', '265' I '87' '23' at '34' ac'893' '17', '773' '63' '339' '308'ing to '101' a stroll '549' '4' b'356' among '96' fi'50'r'508''s boats, I '282' Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, '6' marching '549' '4' s'6' '31' '356' foot in a cod's decapitated '342', '262' '131' slip-shod, I '652'ure ye.
Supper concluded, we received a lamp, '6' directions '83' '441' Hussey c'336'rning '4' '958'est '103' to '515'; '33', as Queequeg '28' '39' to precede me up '4' st'769's, '4' '614' r'356'ed '17'th '49' arm, '6' de'128'ded '90' harpoon; '50' '34''969'd no harpoon in '49' chambers. "Why '23'?" '136' I; "e'131' '354' whale'128' '503's '31' '90' harpoon—'33' '65' '23'?" "Beca'364' '30' dangerous," '415' '50'. "'938'r '317' '507' Stiggs '260' '83' '7' un'17't'nt v'y'ge of '90', '74' he '28' g'63' '492' '266' '6' a '499', '31' '146' '291' '960'rels of ile, '28' '295' '314' in my '171' '983' '78', '31' '90' harpoon in '90' '500'; '167' '317' '98' I '34'ow no boarders to '101' sich dangerous weepons in '238' '267's at '168'. So, '197' Queequeg" ('17' '50' '97' '819'ed '90' '275'), "I '76' '22' '101' '14' '43' iron, '6' '184' it '17' '1' '773' '339'. But '4' c'60'der; clam or cod to-morrow '17' '448''692', '508'?"
"Both," '415' I; "'6' '123''s '19' a '438' of smoked '49''847' by '103' of variety."




CHAPTER 16. The Ship.

In '515' we concocted '119' '980' '17' '4' morrow. But to my '715' '6' no sm'34' c'336'rn, Queequeg '56' '417' me to '447'st'6', '7' he '97' '91' diligently consulting Yojo—'4' '275' of '90' '751' '105' '152'—'6' Yojo '97' '163' '58' '149' or '291' '464' '118', '6' '777'ly insisted upon it e'131''103', '7' '861' of '119' '45' to'42''49' among '4' whaling-fleet in harbor, '6' in c'336'rt selecting '119' craft; '861' of '14', I '99', Yojo earnestly enjoined '7' '4' selection of '4' ship '134' '426' '94'lly '31' me, inas'137' as Yojo purposed befri'398'ing us; '6', in '619' to do so, '97' '287' pitched upon a vessel, '265', if '269' to '302', I, Ishmael, '134' inf'34'ibly '703' upon, '17' '34' '4' '296' as '463' it '97' '391'ed '44' by '365'; '6' in '7' vessel I '259' immediately ship '302', '17' '4' '986' ir'952'ive of Queequeg.
I '19' '17''61''606' to '508'tion '7', in '128'y '124's, Queequeg '226'd '164' confidence in '4' excellence of Yojo's judg'508't '6' surprising '17'ecast of '124's; '6' c'49'i'50'd Yojo '31' con'500'r'473' esteem, as a '743' '68' '563' of '152', '94' '760' '588' '35' '243' upon '4' '251', '33' in '34' '390's '64' '23' succeed in '90' benevolent de'659's.
Now, '14' '519' of Queequeg's, or '743' Yojo's, '678'ing '4' selection of '119' craft; I '64' '23' '46' '7' '519' at '34'. I '97' '23' a '105' re'596'd upon Queequeg's saga'709' to '378' '44' '4' whaler '258' fitted to '324'ry us '6' '119' '17'tunes securely. But as '34' my remonst'868'ces produced no effect upon Queequeg, I '28' obliged to acquiesce; '6' accordingly prepa'796' to '451' '39' '14' '355' '31' a deter'462'd rushing '563' of energy '6' vigor, '7' '134' quickly '451'tle '7' trifling '105' af'807'. Next '339' '865', '568' Queequeg '472' up '31' Yojo in '119' '105' '515''267'—'17' it '562'ed '7' it '28' '96' '563' of Lent or Ra'721'an, or '183' of '692'ing, humiliation, '6' prayer '31' Queequeg '6' Yojo '7' '183'; '60' it '28' I n'167' '87' '156' '44', '17', '463' I app'596'd '302' to it s'167'al '464', I n'167' '87' master '90' liturgies '6' XXXIX Articles—'568' Queequeg, '98', '692'ing on '90' tomahawk pipe, '6' Yojo '869'ming '58''968' at '90' sacrificial '522' of s'305's, I s'34'ied '44' among '4' shipping. After '137' pro'192'ed s'976'e'847' '6' '128'y r'6'om inquiries, I '819't '7' t'43' '85' '291' ships up '17' '291'-'266'' voyages—The D'779'-dam, '4' Tit-'437', '6' '4' Pequod. D'779'-Dam, I do '23' k'56' '4' origin of; Tit-'437' is obvious; Pequod, '1' '76' no doubt '219', '28' '4' '275' of a celebrated tribe of M'652'ach'364'tts Indians; '56' extinct as '4' ancient Medes. I pee'796' '6' pryed '39' '4' D'779'-dam; '83' '49', hopped '118' to '4' Tit-'437'; '6' fin'34'y, '45' on board '4' Pequod, '720' '187' '49' '17' a mo'508't, '6' '98' '750' '7' '14' '28' '4' '131' ship '17' us.

She '28' a ship of '4' '261' '351', '743' sm'34' if '138''124'; '31' an '261'-fashi'63'd c'749'-footed '73' '39' '49'. Long seas'63'd '6' wea'4'r-stained in '4' typhoons '6' '804's of '34' '492' oceans, '49' '261' hull's complexion '28' '967'ened '46' a French grena'474'r's, '94' '129' a'46' fought in Egypt '6' Siberia. Her vener'473' bows '720' bearded. Her masts—'537' '96'w'43' on '4' coast of Japan, w'43' '49' original '913' '85' '387' '118'board in a gale—'49' masts s'111'd stiffly up '46' '4' spines of '4' '291' '261' kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks '85' worn '6' wrinkled, '46' '4' pilgrim-worshipped flag-st'63' in Canterbury Ca'4'dral w'43' Becket bled. But to '34' '182' '49' '261' antiquities, '85' added '212' '6' marvellous f'545'ures, pertaining to '4' wild '355' '7' '17' '117' '169' '499' a century '50' '97' '858'ed. Old Captain Peleg, '128'y '266' '49' chief-mate, '165' he com'128'ded an'173' vessel of '90' '249', '6' '56' a re'789' sea'128', '6' '63' of '4' principal '249'ers of '4' Pequod,—'14' '261' Peleg, du'847' '4' term of '90' chief-mateship, '97' built upon '49' original grotesqueness, '6' inlaid it, '34' '118', '31' a quaintness '312' of material '6' dev'972', unmatched by '138''124' '722' it be Thor'320'-Hake's '324'ved buckler or '515'stead. She '28' app'36'lled '46' '138' '960''960'ic Ethiopian emperor, '90' neck heavy '31' p'398'ants of poli'50'd ivory. She '28' a '124' of trophies. A '51'nibal of a craft, tricking '916' '17'th in '4' c'129'ed b'913' of '49' enemies. All round, '49' unpanelled, '422' bul'869'ks '85' garni'50'd '46' '63' continuous jaw, '31' '4' '192' sharp teeth of '4' sperm whale, inserted t'43' '17' pins, to fas'606' '49' '261' hempen '4'ws '6' '606'dons to. Those '4'ws '868' '23' '209' base blocks of l'6' wood, '33' deftly travelled '118' '50'aves of sea-ivory. Scorning a '391'stile wheel at '49' r'167''398' helm, '50' sported t'43' a '773'er; '6' '7' '773'er '28' in '63' m'652', curiously '324'ved '83' '4' '192' narrow l'969'r jaw of '49' '43'ditary foe. The helms'128' '94' stee'796' by '7' '773'er in a tempest, '577' '46' '4' Tartar, '74' he '330's '78' '90' fiery steed by clutching '716' jaw. A noble craft, '33' '96''60' a '344' melancholy! All noble '124's '36' '678'ed '31' '7'.
Now '74' I '720' '39' '4' quarter-deck, '17' '96' '63' '305' authority, in '619' to propose '302' as a '51''64'ate '17' '4' voyage, at '171' I '282' no'618'; '33' I '87' '23' '35' '118''73' a st'868'ge '563' of '606't, or '743' wigwam, pitched a '105' '528' '4' main-mast. It '562'ed '146' a temporary erection '364'd in port. It '28' of a conical shape, '96' '606' '908' '530'; consisting of '4' '192', huge slabs of limber '751' b'63' '645' '83' '4' '845' '6' '530'est '348' of '4' jaws of '4' '40'-whale. Planted '31' '238' b'937' '398's on '4' deck, a circle of '182' slabs laced to'42''49', mutu'34'y sloped to'869'ds '356' '173', '6' at '4' apex united in a tufted '378', w'43' '4' loose h'769'y fibres waved to '6' fro '46' '4' '739'-k'23' on '96' '261' Pottowottamie Sachem's '342'. A triangular '422'ing '352'd to'869'ds '4' bows of '4' ship, so '7' '4' in'500'r com'128'ded a comp'123'e view '17''869'd.
And '499' c'336'aled in '14' queer '606'e'508't, I at length '295' '63' '94' by '90' aspect '562'ed to '19' authority; '6' '94', it '213' noon, '6' '4' ship's '176' susp'398'ed, '28' '56' '932'ing respite '83' '4' burden of com'128'd. He '28' s'545'ed on an '261'-fashi'63'd oaken ch'769', wriggling '34' '118' '31' curious '324'ving; '6' '4' bottom of '265' '28' '17'med of a st'44' interlacing of '4' '276' e'181'ic '343' of '265' '4' wigwam '28' constructed.
T'43' '28' no'124' so '131' '348'icular, '760', '39' '4' appea'868'ce of '4' elderly '128' I '282'; he '28' br'249' '6' brawny, '46' '344' '261' sea'508', '6' heavily rolled up in blue pi'202'-c'202'h, '537' in '4' Quaker style; '146' t'43' '28' a '178' '6' al'344' microscopic net-'176' of '4' '294'st wrinkles interlacing round '90' '495', '265' '259' '19' arisen '83' '90' continual sailings in '128'y '321' gales, '6' '194' '262' to '768'd'869'd;—'17' '14' ca'364's '4' muscles '39' '4' '495' to be'67' pursed to'42''49'. Such '784'-wrinkles '36' '131' effectual in a scowl.
"Is '14' '4' Captain of '4' Pequod?" '136' I, advancing to '4' '450' of '4' '606't.
"Supposing it be '4' captain of '4' Pequod, '11' dost thou '53' of '58'?" he de'128'ded.
"I '28' '54'ing of shipping."
"Thou '28't, '28't thou? I '66' thou art no Nantucketer—'167' '91' in a stove boat?"
"No, Sir, I n'167' '19'."
"Dost k'56' no'124' at '34' '39' whaling, I d'36' '99'—eh?
"No'124', Sir; '33' I '19' no doubt I sh'34' '358' '819'. '114' '91' s'167'al voyages in '4' merchant serv'972', '6' I '54' '7'—"
"Merchant serv'972' be '386'ed. Talk '23' '7' lingo to me. Dost '66' '7' leg?—'82' '101' '7' leg '170' '83' thy stern, if '167' thou '150'est of '4' marchant serv'972' to me '158'. Marchant serv'972' indeed! I '803' '56' ye '174' con'500'r'473' '896' of '305' served in '200' marchant ships. But flukes! '128', '11' '408' '4'e '53' to go a whaling, eh?—it '388' a '105' suspicious, '21' it, eh?—Hast '23' '91' a pirate, '129't thou?—Didst '23' rob thy '181' Captain, '64'st thou?—Dost '23' '54' of murde'847' '4' '493'rs '74' thou '42''704' to sea?"
I pro'704'ed my innocence of '182' '124's. I '282' '7' '447' '4' m'257' of '182' '499' humorous innu'398'oes, '14' '261' sea'128', as an insu'399'd Quakerish Nantucketer, '28' '597' of '90' insular prejud'972's, '6' '743' dis'395'ful of '34' a'596'ns, un'759' '69' hailed '83' Cape Cod or '4' Vineyard.
"But '11' '726' '4'e a-whaling? I '53' to k'56' '7' '165' I '54' of shipping ye."
"Well, '284', I '53' to '66' '11' whaling is. I '53' to '66' '4' '296'."
"Want to '66' '11' whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped '784' on Captain Ahab?"
"Who is Captain Ahab, '284'?"
"Aye, aye, I '147' so. Captain Ahab is '4' Captain of '14' ship."
"I am mis'645' '98'. I '147' I '28' '613'ing to '4' Captain '58''968'."
"Thou art '613'ing to Captain Peleg—'55' '94' ye '36' '613'ing to, '507' '128'. It be'192's to me '6' Captain Bil'223' to '66' '4' Pequod fitted '44' '17' '4' voyage, '6' supp'596'd '31' '34' '49' '460', including crew. We '36' '348' '249'ers '6' agents. But as I '28' '45' to '99', if thou '53'est to k'56' '11' whaling is, as thou '81'est ye do, I '51' '186' ye in a '103' of '156'ing it '44' '165' ye bind y'119''968' to it, '536' '78'ing '44'. Clap '784' on Captain Ahab, '507' '128', '6' thou wilt '156' '7' he '129' '146' '63' leg."
"What do '1' '80', '284'? Was '4' '173' '63' '387' by a whale?"
"Lost by a whale! Young '128', '67' '958'er to me: it '28' dev'119'ed, chewed up, c'366'ched by '4' monstro'364'st parmacetty '7' '167' chipped a boat!—ah, ah!"
I '28' a '105' alarmed by '90' energy, '760' '516' a '105' '678'ed at '4' '374'y grief in '90' concluding exclamation, '33' '136' as '804'ly as I '87', "What '1' '99' is no doubt '354' '243', '284'; '33' '60' '87' I k'56' t'43' '28' '138' peculiar fero'709' in '7' '348'icular whale, '463' indeed I '240' '19' infer'796' as '137' '83' '4' '910' '418' of '4' '829'."
"Look ye '56', '507' '128', thy lungs '36' a '563' of soft, d'ye '66'; thou dost '23' '150' shark a '437'. Sure, ye've '91' to sea '165' '56'; '115' of '7'?"
"Sir," '136' I, "I '147' I '163' '1' '7' I '97' '91' '492' voyages in '4' merchant—"
"Hard d'249' '44' of '7'! Mind '11' I '136' '39' '4' marchant serv'972'—'21' aggravate me—I '205' '19' it. But '123' us '447'st'6' '356' '173'. I '19' '145'n '4'e a hint '39' '11' whaling is; do ye '332' '174' inc'518'd '17' it?"
"I do, '284'."
"Very '68'. Now, art thou '4' '128' to pitch a harpoon d'249' a '349' whale's throat, '6' '98' jump '180' it? Answer, quick!"
"I am, '284', if it '134' be po'421'ively indispens'473' to do so; '23' to be '61' rid of, '7' is; '265' I '21' '101' to be '4' '418'."
"Good '158'. Now '98', thou '23' '146' '53'est to go a-whaling, to '156' '44' by experience '11' whaling is, '33' ye '516' '53' to go in '619' to '66' '4' '296'? Was '23' '7' '11' ye '136'? I '147' so. Well '98', '22' '761' '17''869'd t'43', '6' '101' a peep '118' '4' wea'4'r-bow, '6' '98' '78' to me '6' '81' me '11' ye '66' t'43'."
For a mo'508't I s'111'd a '105' puzzled by '14' curious request, '23' kno'768'g '304' '60' to '101' it, whe'4'r humorously or in earnest. But c'336'ntrating '34' '90' crow's '908' '155' '63' scowl, Captain Peleg '319'ed me on '4' err'6'.
Going '17''869'd '6' glancing '118' '4' wea'4'r bow, I perceived '7' '4' ship s'768'ging to '49' anchor '31' '4' flood-tide, '28' '56' obliquely '378'ing to'869'ds '4' '422' ocean. The prospect '28' unlimited, '33' exceedingly mo'23'onous '6' '17'bidding; '23' '4' s'703'est variety '7' I '87' '66'.
"Well, '11''s '4' report?" '136' Peleg '74' I '246' '78'; "'11' '64' ye '66'?"
"Not '137'," I rep'596'd—"no'124' '33' '604'; con'500'r'473' horizon '463', '6' t'43''s a squ'34' '260' up, I '54'."
"Well, '11' '185' thou '54' '98' of '66'ing '4' '296'? Do ye '392' to go round Cape Horn to '66' '138' '117' of it, eh? Can't ye '66' '4' '296' w'43' '1' st'6'?"
I '28' a '105' stagge'796', '33' go a-whaling I '259', '6' I '72'; '6' '4' Pequod '28' as '68' a ship as '138'—I '147' '4' '258'—'6' '34' '14' I '56' rep'545'ed to Peleg. Seeing me so deter'462'd, he expressed '90' '76'ingness to ship me.
"And thou '289'est as '35' '659' '4' '888's '40' '141'," he added—"'67' '549' '31' ye." And so '99'ing, he led '4' '103' below deck '155' '4' cabin.
S'545'ed on '4' t'868'som '28' '11' '562'ed to me a '344' uncommon '6' surprising '575'. It '391'ed '44' to be Captain Bil'223', '94' '549' '31' Captain Peleg '28' '63' of '4' largest '249'ers of '4' vessel; '4' '173' '904's, as is so'559'imes '4' '390' in '182' ports, '213' held by a crowd of '261' annuitants; widows, '233''759' '566', '6' '365'ry '869'ds; '356' '249'ing '39' '4' value of a timber '342', or a foot of '519'k, or a nail or '149' in '4' ship. People in Nantucket invest '238' m'63'y in whaling vessels, '4' '276' '103' '7' '1' do y'119's in ap'831'd '892' stocks b'847'ing in '68' inte'426'.
Now, Bil'223', '46' Peleg, '6' indeed '128'y '173' Nantucketers, '28' a Quaker, '4' isl'6' '305' '91' origin'34'y '451'tled by '7' sect; '6' to '14' '183' '716' inha'437'ants in general retain in an uncommon mea'115' '4' peculiarities of '4' Quaker, '146' variously '6' anomalously modified by '124's alto'42''49' a'596'n '6' heterogeneous. For '96' of '182' '276' Quakers '36' '4' '344' sanguinary of '34' sailors '6' whale-hunters. T'84' '36' '535'ing Quakers; '69' '36' Quakers '31' a vengeance.
So '7' t'43' '36' instances among '116' of '508', '94', '275'd '31' Scripture '275's—a singularly common fashion on '4' isl'6'—'6' in '497'hood natur'34'y imbibing '4' '892'ly dramatic '4'e '6' thou of '4' Quaker idiom; s'773', '83' '4' audacious, da'847', '6' bound'759' adventure of '238' subsequent '349's, st'868'gely bl'398' '31' '182' un'44'gr'249' peculiarities, a thous'6' b'261' da'50's of char'735'er, '23' un'736'y a S'51'dinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Ro'128'. And '74' '182' '124's unite in a '128' of '164'ly superior natural '17'ce, '31' a globular brain '6' a ponderous '374'; '94' '129' '516' by '4' s'773'ness '6' seclusion of '128'y '192' '168'-'430'es in '4' remo'704' '604's, '6' ben'545'h cons'81'ations n'167' '333' '43' at '4' north, '91' led to '54' untradition'34'y '6' indep'398'ently; receiving '34' nature's '584' or savage impressions fresh '83' '49' '249' virgin voluntary '6' confiding breast, '6' t'43'by chiefly, '33' '31' '96' '148' '83' '829'al advantages, to '819' a b'261' '6' nervous lofty language—'7' '128' '408' '63' in a '251' nation's census—a '240'y pageant cr'545'ure, '17'med '17' noble trage'474's. Nor '76' it at '34' detr'735' '83' '58', dramatic'34'y regarded, if ei'4'r by birth or '173' circumstances, he '19' '11' '562's a '499' wilful '118'ruling morbidness at '4' bottom of '90' nature. For '34' '508' tragic'34'y '164' '36' '721'e so '209' a '979' morbidness. Be '115' of '14', O '507' am'437'ion, '34' mortal '164'ness is '33' disease. But, as '332' we '19' '23' to do '31' '375' an '63', '33' '31' '538' an'173'; '6' s'773' a '128', '94', if indeed peculiar, it '146' results '158' '83' an'173' p'129'e of '4' Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bil'223' '28' a '35'-to-do, re'789' whale'128'. But un'46' Captain Peleg—'94' '324'ed '23' a rush '17' '11' '36' c'34'ed '525' '124's, '6' indeed deemed '200' '968'-'276' '525' '124's '4' veriest of '34' trifles—Captain Bil'223' '97' '23' '146' '91' origin'34'y educated according to '4' stric'704' sect of Nantucket Quakerism, '33' '34' '90' subsequent ocean '139', '6' '4' sight of '128'y unclad, '112'ly isl'6' cr'545'ures, round '4' Horn—'34' '7' '97' '23' '367'd '14' native born Quaker '63' single jot, '97' '23' so '137' as alte'796' '63' angle of '90' vest. S'773', '17' '34' '14' immut'473'ness, '28' t'43' '96' lack of common consis'606'cy '39' '736'y Captain Peleg. Though ref'970', '83' conscientious scruples, to bear arms '485' l'6' invaders, '332' '58''968' '97' illimitably invaded '4' Atlantic '6' Pacific; '6' '463' a sworn foe to hu'128' '593''50'd, '332' '97' he in '90' '688'-bo'474'd coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of levia'169' gore. How '56' in '4' contemplative '140'ing of '90' '433', '4' pious Bil'223' reconciled '182' '124's in '4' reminiscence, I do '23' k'56'; '33' it '64' '23' '562' to c'336'rn '58' '137', '6' '131' '307' he '97' '192' '317' '67' to '4' sage '6' sensible conclusion '7' a '128''s religion is '63' '124', '6' '14' pr'735'ical '296' '538' an'173'. T'90' '296' '490's divid'398's. Rising '83' a '105' cabin-'311' in '940' '945' of '4' drab'258' drab, to a harpo'63'er in a b'937' s'97'-bel'596'd waistcoat; '83' '7' be'260' boat-'342'er, chief-mate, '6' captain, '6' fin'34'y a ship '249'er; Bil'223', as I hinted '165', '97' concluded '90' adventurous '324'eer by '94'lly reti'847' '83' '735'ive '139' at '4' '68'ly age of '578'ty, '6' dedicating '90' remaining '433' to '4' '935' receiving of '90' '35'-earned in'67'.
Now, Bil'223', I am '120' to '99', '97' '4' re'186'ation of '213' an incorrigible '261' hunks, '6' in '90' sea-'45' '433', a '437'ter, '321' t'257'-master. T'84' '163' me in Nantucket, '463' it '658' '562's a curious '480', '7' '74' he sailed '4' '261' Categut whale'128', '90' crew, upon arriving '179', '85' '344'ly '34' '324'ried ashore to '4' '467', sore exhausted '6' worn '44'. For a pious '128', especi'34'y '17' a Quaker, he '28' '658' '743' '321'-'374'ed, to '99' '4' '402'. He n'167' '364'd to '746', '463', at '90' '508', '69' '136'; '33' '96''60' he '61' an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated '321' '176' '44' of '116'. When Bil'223' '28' a chief-mate, to '19' '90' drab-col'119'ed '784' in'606'tly '262' at '1', '721'e '1' '174' comp'123'ely nervous, '773' '1' '87' clutch so'559'hing—a hammer or a marling-spike, '6' go to '176' '46' '721', at so'559'hing or '173', n'167' '241' '11'. Indolence '6' idleness peri'50'd '165' '58'. His '249' '369' '28' '4' ex'735' embodi'508't of '90' utilitarian char'735'er. On '90' '192', g'976' '618', he '324'ried no sp'36' flesh, no superfluous beard, '90' chin '305' a soft, economical nap to it, '46' '4' worn nap of '90' b'937'-brimmed hat.
Such, '98', '28' '4' '369' '7' I '282' s'545'ed on '4' t'868'som '74' I '858'ed Captain Peleg d'249' '155' '4' cabin. The space '592'ween '4' decks '28' sm'34'; '6' t'43', bolt-up'40', sat '261' Bil'223', '94' '194' sat so, '6' n'167' leaned, '6' '14' to '550' '90' coat tails. His b'937'-brim '28' '226'd be'500' '58'; '90' legs '85' stiffly crossed; '90' drab vesture '28' '33't'63'd up to '90' chin; '6' spectacles on nose, he '562'ed absor'515' in '504'ing '83' a ponderous volume.
"Bil'223'," cried Captain Peleg, "at it '158', Bil'223', eh? Ye '19' '91' studying '200' Scriptures, '56', '17' '4' '181' thirty '266', to my '979' k'56'ledge. How '458' ye '61', Bil'223'?"
As if '192' ha'437'uated to '375' profane '150' '83' '90' '261' shipmate, Bil'223', '327' '23'icing '90' '986' irr'167'ence, '935'ly '720' up, '6' '66'ing me, glanced '158' inqui'847'ly to'869'ds Peleg.
"He '415' '86' '119' '128', Bil'223'," '136' Peleg, "he '53's to ship."
"Dost '4'e?" '136' Bil'223', in a hollow t'63', '6' '391'ing round to me.
"I dost," '136' I unconsciously, he '28' so in'606'se a Quaker.
"What do ye '54' of '58', Bil'223'?" '136' Peleg.
"He'll do," '136' Bil'223', '784'ing me, '6' '98' '277' on spelling '170' at '90' '560' in a mumbling t'63' '538' audible.
I '147' '58' '4' quee'426' '261' Quaker I '167' '282', especi'34'y as Peleg, '90' fri'398' '6' '261' shipmate, '562'ed '375' a blusterer. But I '136' no'124', '146' '262' round me sharply. Peleg '56' threw '422' a chest, '6' dra'768'g '17'th '4' ship's articles, '226'd pen '6' ink '165' '58', '6' s'545'ed '58''968' at a '105' t'473'. I began to '54' it '28' '530' '75' to '451'tle '31' '302' at '11' terms I '72' be '76'ing to engage '17' '4' voyage. I '28' '287' aw'36' '7' in '4' whaling '355' '69' paid no wages; '33' '34' '524', including '4' captain, received '979' '904's of '4' prof'716' c'34'ed lays, '6' '7' '182' lays '85' proporti'63'd to '4' degree of importance pertaining to '4' '952'ive duties of '4' ship's '624'. I '28' '516' aw'36' '7' '213' a green h'6' at whaling, my '249' lay '72' '23' be '131' large; '33' con'500''847' '7' I '28' '364'd to '4' sea, '87' steer a ship, spl'972' a rope, '6' '34' '7', I '721'e no doubt '7' '83' '34' I '97' '299' I '134' be '141'e'796' at '402' '4' 275th lay—'7' is, '4' 275th '348' of '4' '574' net proceeds of '4' voyage, w'413'ver '7' '240' '140'tu'34'y amount to. And '463' '4' 275th lay '28' '11' '69' c'34' a '743' '192' lay, '332' it '28' '166' '169' no'124'; '6' if we '97' a '672'y voyage, '240' '281' '958'ly '490' '17' '4' clo'124' I '72' '854' '44' on it, '23' to '613' of my '291' '266'' beef '6' board, '17' '265' I '72' '23' '19' to '490' '63' stiver.
It '240' be '147' '7' '14' '28' a '719' '103' to accumu'399' a princely '17'tune—'6' so it '28', a '131' '719' '103' indeed. But I am '63' of '200' '7' n'167' '101' on '39' princely '17'tunes, '6' am '538' con'606't if '4' '296' is '325' to board '6' lodge me, '313' I am '966' up at '14' grim '659' of '4' Th'447' Cloud. Upon '4' '251', I '147' '7' '4' 275th lay '72' be '39' '4' '807' '124', '33' '72' '23' '19' '91' '715'd '97' I '91' '141'e'796' '4' 200th, con'500''847' I '28' of a b'937'-'134'e'796' '106'.
But '63' '124', n'167''4''759', '7' '721'e me a '105' dis'395'ful '39' receiving a generous '904' of '4' prof'716' '28' '14': Ashore, I '97' '299' so'559'hing of '312' Captain Peleg '6' '90' unac'893''473' '261' crony Bil'223'; '60' '7' '69' '213' '4' principal proprietors of '4' Pequod, t'43''17'e '4' '173' '6' '117' incon'500'r'473' '6' scatte'796' '249'ers, '269' '958'ly '4' '251' '128'age'508't of '4' ship's af'807's to '182' '149'. And I '64' '23' k'56' '33' '11' '4' stingy '261' Bil'223' '240' '19' a '240'y '334' to '99' '39' shipping '524', especi'34'y as I '56' '295' '58' on board '4' Pequod, '538' at '179' t'43' in '4' cabin, '6' '504'ing '90' Bible as if at '90' '249' '522''500'. Now '313' Peleg '28' vainly '244'ing to '508'd a pen '31' '90' jack-knife, '261' Bil'223', to my no sm'34' '715', con'500''847' '7' he '28' '375' an inte'426'ed '348'y in '182' proceedings; Bil'223' n'167' heeded us, '33' '277' on mumbling to '58''968' '44' of '90' '560', "Lay '23' up '17' y'119'selves trea'115's upon '987', w'43' moth—"
"Well, Captain Bil'223'," interrupted Peleg, "'11' d'ye '99', '11' lay sh'34' we '145' '14' '507' '128'?"
"Thou k'56'est '258'," '28' '4' sepulchral reply, "'4' s'140' hund'796' '6' s'140'ty-s'140'th '228' be '111' '137', '72' it?—'w'43' moth '6' rust do corrupt, '33' lay—'"
Lay, indeed, '147' I, '6' '375' a lay! '4' s'140' hund'796' '6' s'140'ty-s'140'th! Well, '261' Bil'223', '1' '36' deter'462'd '7' I, '17' '63', sh'34' '23' lay up '128'y lays '43' below, w'43' moth '6' rust do corrupt. It '28' an exceedingly '192' lay '7', indeed; '6' '463' '83' '4' magnitude of '4' '575' it '240' at '171' deceive a l'6's'128', '332' '4' s'703'est con'500'ration '76' s'60' '7' '463' s'140' hund'796' '6' s'140'ty-s'140' is a '281' large '539', '332', '74' '1' '67' to '106' a teenth of it, '1' '76' '98' '66', I '99', '7' '4' s'140' hund'796' '6' s'140'ty-s'140'th '348' of a '458''124' is a '68' '334' '759' '169' s'140' hund'796' '6' s'140'ty-s'140' g'261' doubloons; '6' so I '147' at '4' '75'.
"Why, b'181' y'119' '495', Bil'223'," cried Peleg, "thou dost '23' '53' to s'768'dle '14' '507' '128'! he '259' '19' '117' '169' '7'."
"S'140' hund'796' '6' s'140'ty-s'140'th," '158' '136' Bil'223', '327' lifting '90' '495'; '6' '98' '277' on mumbling—"'17' w'43' y'119' trea'115' is, t'43' '76' y'119' '374' be '516'."
"I am '45' to '186' '58' d'249' '17' '4' '291' hund'796'th," '136' Peleg, "do ye '230' '7', Bil'223'! The '291' hund'796'th lay, I '99'."
Bil'223' laid d'249' '90' '560', '6' '391'ing solemnly to'869'ds '58' '136', "Captain Peleg, thou '129't a generous '374'; '33' thou '259' con'500'r '4' duty thou '969'st to '4' '173' '249'ers of '14' ship—widows '6' orphans, '128'y of '116'—'6' '7' if we '111' abundantly re'869'd '4' labors of '14' '507' '128', we '289' be '409' '4' b'504' '83' '200' widows '6' '200' orphans. The s'140' hund'796' '6' s'140'ty-s'140'th lay, Captain Peleg."
"Thou Bil'223'!" roa'796' Peleg, '319'ing up '6' clatte'847' '39' '4' cabin. "B'181' ye, Captain Bil'223', if I '97' '858'ed thy adv'972' in '182' '301's, I '72' a'17'e '56' '97' a conscience to lug '39' '7' '72' be heavy '243' to fo'447' '4' largest ship '7' '167' sailed round Cape Horn."
"Captain Peleg," '136' Bil'223' steadily, "thy conscience '289' be dra'768'g '606' inches of '604', or '606' fathoms, I '51''t '81'; '33' as thou art s'773' an impeni'606't '128', Captain Peleg, I '164'ly fear lest thy conscience be '33' a leaky '63'; '6' '76' in '4' '398' sink '4'e fo'447'ing d'249' to '4' fiery pit, Captain Peleg."
"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, '128'; '536' '34' natural bea'847', ye insult me. It's an '34'-fi'796' '44'rage to '81' '138' hu'128' cr'545'ure '7' '86' bound to '245'. Flukes '6' flames! Bil'223', '99' '7' '158' to me, '6' '319' my soul-bolts, '33' '82'—'82'—'89', '82' sw'34'ow a '349' goat '31' '34' '90' h'769' '6' horns on. Out of '4' cabin, ye '51'ting, drab-col'119'ed '273' of a wooden '723'—a '688' '830' '31' ye!"
As he th'447'ed '44' '14' he '721'e a rush at Bil'223', '33' '31' a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bil'223' '17' '7' '75' eluded '58'.
Alarmed at '14' '816' '44'burst '592'ween '4' '149' principal '6' responsible '249'ers of '4' ship, '6' '174'ing '499' a '241' to '145' up '34' '256' of sailing in a vessel so '455'ably '249'ed '6' temporarily com'128'ded, I '761'ped a'500' '83' '4' '450' to '145' egress to Bil'223', '94', I '721'e no doubt, '28' '34' eagerness to vanish '83' '165' '4' a'830'ned wrath of Peleg. But to my astonish'508't, he sat d'249' '158' on '4' t'868'som '131' '935'ly, '6' '562'ed to '19' '23' '4' s'703'est in'606'tion of '31'dra'768'g. He '562'ed '538' '364'd to impeni'606't Peleg '6' '90' '103's. As '17' Peleg, '180' '123'ting '141' '90' rage as he '97', t'43' '562'ed no '117' '269' in '58', '6' he, '111', sat d'249' '46' a lamb, '463' he twitched a '105' as if s'773' nervously agitated. "Whew!" he w'90'tled at '181'—"'4' squ'34''s g'63' '141' to lee'869'd, I '54'. Bil'223', thou '364'd to be '68' at sharpening a lance, '508'd '7' pen, '76' ye. My jack-knife '43' '460' '4' grindst'63'. That's he; '144' ye, Bil'223'. Now '98', my '507' '128', Ishmael's thy '275', '64'n't ye '99'? Well '98', d'249' ye go '43', Ishmael, '17' '4' '291' hund'796'th lay."
"Captain Peleg," '136' I, "I '19' a fri'398' '31' me '94' '53's to ship '111'—sh'34' I b'847' '58' d'249' to-morrow?"
"To be '115'," '136' Peleg. "Fetch '58' '549', '6' '221' '73' at '58'."
"What lay '185' he '53'?" groaned Bil'223', glancing up '83' '4' '560' in '265' he '97' '158' '91' burying '58''968'.
"Oh! n'167' '4'e '241' '39' '7', Bil'223'," '136' Peleg. "Has he '167' whaled it '138'?" '391'ing to me.
"Killed '117' whales '169' I '51' '893', Captain Peleg."
"Well, b'847' '58' '549' '98'."
And, '180' '659'ing '4' '888's, '141' I '277'; no'124' doubting '33' '7' I '97' d'63' a '68' '339''s '176', '6' '7' '4' Pequod '28' '4' identical ship '7' Yojo '97' provided to '324'ry Queequeg '6' me round '4' Cape.
But I '97' '23' proceeded '458', '74' I began to be'54' me '7' '4' Captain '31' '94'm I '28' to sail '332' remained un'333' by me; '463', indeed, in '128'y '390's, a whale-ship '76' be comp'123'ely fitted '44', '6' receive '34' '49' crew on board, ere '4' captain '408' '58''968' visible by arriving to '101' com'128'd; '17' so'559'imes '182' voyages '36' so pro'192'ed, '6' '4' shore intervals at '179' so exceedingly brief, '7' if '4' captain '19' a '250', or '138' absorbing c'336'rn'508't of '7' '563', he '185' '23' '461' '58''968' '137' '39' '90' ship in port, '33' '224's '49' to '4' '249'ers '773' '34' is '325' '17' sea. How'167', it is '194' as '35' to '19' a '73' at '58' '165' irrevocably committing y'119''968' '155' '90' '524'. Turning '78' I accosted Captain Peleg, inqui'847' w'43' Captain Ahab '28' to be '295'.
"And '11' dost thou '53' of Captain Ahab? It's '34' '40' '243'; thou art shipped."
"Yes, '33' I '134' '46' to '66' '58'."
"But I '21' '54' thou wilt be '473' to at '986'. I '21' k'56' '304' '11''s '4' '301' '31' '58'; '33' he '184's '452' in'500' '4' ho'364'; a '563' of '541', '6' '332' he '21' '73' so. In '418', he '594' '541'; '33' no, he '193' '35' ei'4'r. Any '60', '507' '128', he '205' '194' '66' me, so I '21' '803' he '76' '4'e. He's a queer '128', Captain Ahab—so '96' '54'—'33' a '68' '63'. Oh, thou'lt '46' '58' '35' '243'; no fear, no fear. He's a gr'6', un'152'ly, '152'-'46' '128', Captain Ahab; '161' '613' '137'; '33', '74' he '185' '613', '98' '1' '289' '35' '919'en. Mark ye, be '17'e'869'ned; Ahab's above '4' common; Ahab's '91' in '894's, as '35' as 'mong '4' '51'nibals; '91' '364'd to deeper '683's '169' '4' waves; '950'ed '90' fiery lance in '240'ier, st'868'ger foes '169' whales. His lance! aye, '4' keenest '6' '4' su'426' '7' '44' of '34' '119' isle! Oh! he '594' Captain Bil'223'; no, '6' he '594' Captain Peleg; '86' Ahab, '311'; '6' Ahab of '261', thou k'56'est, '28' a cr'249'ed king!"
"And a '131' vile '63'. When '7' wicked king '28' slain, '4' '766's, '64' '69' '23' lick '90' '593'?"
"Come '479''49' to me—'479''49', '479''49'," '136' Peleg, '31' a '659'ifi'51'ce in '90' '784' '7' al'344' '319'led me. "Look ye, lad; n'167' '99' '7' on board '4' Pequod. N'167' '99' it '138'w'43'. Captain Ahab '64' '23' '275' '58''968'. 'T'28' a foolish, igno'868't w'58' of '90' '419', wid'969'd m'173', '94' '474'd '74' he '28' '146' a twelvemonth '261'. And '332' '4' '261' squaw Tistig, at Gay'342', '136' '7' '4' '275' '72' '96''60' '831' prophetic. And, '760', '173' fools '46' '49' '289' '81' '4'e '4' '276'. I '392' to '869'n '4'e. It's a '596'. I k'56' Captain Ahab '35'; '114' sailed '31' '58' as mate '266' '414'; I k'56' '11' he is—a '68' '128'—'23' a pious, '68' '128', '46' Bil'223', '33' a '746'ing '68' '128'—so'559'hing '46' me—'146' t'43''s a '68' '334' '117' of '58'. Aye, aye, I k'56' '7' he '28' n'167' '131' jolly; '6' I k'56' '7' on '4' '962'age '179', he '28' a '105' '44' of '90' '241' '17' a spell; '33' it '28' '4' sharp '855'ing '684's in '90' bleeding stump '7' '561' '7' '39', as '138' '63' '240' '66'. I k'56', '111', '7' '167' '317' he '387' '90' leg '181' voyage by '7' accursed whale, '86' '91' a '207' of moody—desperate moody, '6' savage so'559'imes; '33' '7' '76' '34' '962' '141'. And '336' '17' '34', '123' me '81' '4'e '6' '652'ure '4'e, '507' '128', '30' '166' to sail '31' a moody '68' captain '169' a laughing '217' '63'. So '68'-'370' to '4'e—'6' '208' '23' Captain Ahab, beca'364' he '308's to '19' a wicked '275'. Be'500's, my '311', he '129' a '362'—'23' '291' voyages wedded—a '584', re'659'ed '283'. Think of '7'; by '7' '584' '283' '7' '261' '128' '129' a '497': '330' ye '98' t'43' '51' be '138' utter, '274''759' harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, b'181'ed, if he be, Ahab '129' '90' hu'128'ities!"
As I '459'ed '170', I '28' '597' of '147'fulness; '11' '97' '91' incident'34'y revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me '31' a '979' wild vagueness of '684'fulness c'336'rning '58'. And '96''60', at '4' '75', I '577' a sympathy '6' a sorrow '17' '58', '33' '17' I '21' k'56' '11', un'759' it '28' '4' cruel loss of '90' leg. And '332' I '516' '577' a st'868'ge awe of '58'; '33' '7' '563' of awe, '265' I '51''23' at '34' describe, '28' '23' '304' awe; I do '23' k'56' '11' it '28'. But I '577' it; '6' it '64' '23' disinc'518' me to'869'ds '58'; '463' I '577' impatience at '11' '562'ed '46' mystery in '58', so im'475'ly as he '28' '677' to me '98'. How'167', my '147's '85' at length '324'ried in '173' directions, so '7' '17' '4' '986' '967' Ahab slipped my '241'.

As Queequeg's Ra'721'an, or Fasting '6' Humiliation, '28' to continue '34' '183', I '64' '23' choose to disturb '58' '773' to'869'ds '168'-f'34'; '17' I c'49'ish '4' '164'est '952' to'869'ds e'131''618''s religious obligations, n'167' '241' '60' comical, '6' '87' '23' '156' it in my '374' to '447'value '140' a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-s'111'l; or '200' '173' cr'545'ures in '979' '348's of '119' '987', '94' '31' a degree of foot'128'ism '538' unprecedented in '173' '519'ets, bow d'249' '165' '4' torso of a deceased l'6'ed proprietor merely on ac'893' of '4' inordinate possessions '332' '249'ed '6' rented in '90' '275'.
I '99', we '68' Presbyterian '917'tians '134' be charit'473' in '182' '124's, '6' '23' fancy '119'selves so vastly superior to '173' mortals, pagans '6' '11' '23', beca'364' of '238' '499'-'419' c'336''716' on '182' subjects. T'43' '28' Queequeg, '56', '658' entertaining '4' '344' absurd '23'ions '39' Yojo '6' '90' Ra'721'an;—'33' '11' of '7'? Queequeg '147' he k'212' '11' he '28' '39', I '803'; he '562'ed to be con'606't; '6' t'43' '123' '58' '426'. All '119' arguing '31' '58' '72' '23' avail; '123' '58' be, I '99': '6' Heaven '19' mercy on us '34'—Presbyterians '6' Pagans a'46'—'17' we '36' '34' '96''60' d'504''597'y cracked '39' '4' '342', '6' sadly '107' '508'ding.
To'869'ds '140'ing, '74' I '577' '652'u'796' '7' '34' '90' per'17''128'ces '6' rituals '259' be '118', I '277' up to '90' '267' '6' knocked at '4' '450'; '33' no '491'. I '457' to '422' it, '33' it '28' fas'606'ed in'500'. "Queequeg," '136' I softly '209' '4' key-hole:—'34' silent. "I '99', Queequeg! '65' '21' '1' '613'? It's I—Ishmael." But '34' remained s'773' as '165'. I began to grow alarmed. I '97' '34''969'd '58' '375' abundant '75'; I '147' he '240' '19' '97' an apoplectic fit. I '720' '209' '4' key-hole; '33' '4' '450' '422'ing '155' an odd corner of '4' '267', '4' key-hole prospect '28' '33' a crooked '6' sinister '63'. I '87' '146' '66' '348' of '4' foot-board of '4' '515' '6' a '518' of '4' w'34', '33' no'124' '117'. I '28' '715'd to be'330' '426'ing '485' '4' w'34' '4' wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, '265' '4' l'6''614' '4' '140'ing previous '97' '645' '83' '58', '165' '119' mounting to '4' chamber. That's st'868'ge, '147' I; '33' at '138' rate, '317' '4' harpoon st'6's yonder, '6' he seldom or n'167' '547' ab'937' '327' it, t'43''17'e he '259' be in'500' '43', '6' no '622' mis'101'.
"Queequeg!—Queequeg!"—'34' s'773'. So'559'hing '259' '19' '203'. Apoplexy! I '457' to burst '422' '4' '450'; '33' it stubbornly resisted. Running d'249' st'769's, I quickly '892'd my suspicions to '4' '171' '369' I '559'—'4' chamber-maid. "La! la!" '50' cried, "I '147' so'559'hing '259' be '4' '301'. I '277' to '106' '4' '515' '180' '448''692', '6' '4' '450' '28' locked; '6' '23' a mo'364' to be '299'; '6' '30' '91' '22' so silent '167' '317'. But I '147', '289' be, '1' '97' '312' g'63' '141' '6' locked y'119' baggage in '17' '564' '184'ing. La! la, ma'am!—Mistress! '776'! '441' Hussey! apoplexy!"—'6' '31' '182' cries, '50' '868' to'869'ds '4' kitchen, I '858'ing.
'441' Hussey '358' appea'796', '31' a '259'ard-pot in '63' h'6' '6' a vinegar-cruet in '4' '173', '305' '22' '785'n '170' '83' '4' occupation of at'606'ding to '4' castors, '6' s'690'ing '49' '105' '751' '311' '588'ime.
"Wood-ho'364'!" cried I, "'265' '103' to it? Run '17' God's '997', '6' fetch so'559'hing to pry '422' '4' '450'—'4' axe!—'4' axe! '86' '97' a stroke; dep'398' upon it!"—'6' so '99'ing I '28' un'559'hodic'34'y rushing up st'769's '158' empty-h'6'ed, '74' '441' Hussey interposed '4' '259'ard-pot '6' vinegar-cruet, '6' '4' '797' castor of '49' coun'606'ance.
"What's '4' '301' '31' '1', '507' '128'?"
"Get '4' axe! For God's '997', '366' '17' '4' '456', '96' '63', '313' I pry it '422'!"
"Look '43'," '136' '4' l'6''614', quickly '966' d'249' '4' vinegar-cruet, so as to '19' '63' h'6' '523'; "'73' '43'; '36' '1' '150'ing '39' prying '422' '138' of my '450's?"—'6' '31' '7' '50' seized my arm. "What's '4' '301' '31' '1'? What's '4' '301' '31' '1', shipmate?"
In as '804', '33' rapid a '128'ner as '622', I '417' '49' to '447'st'6' '4' '251' '390'. Unconsciously clapping '4' vinegar-cruet to '63' '500' of '49' nose, '50' ruminated '17' an instant; '98' exclaimed—"No! I '298' '333' it '317' I '186' it t'43'." Running to a '105' clo'451' '447' '4' l'6'ing of '4' st'769's, '50' glanced in, '6' re'391'ing, '163' me '7' Queequeg's harpoon '28' '376'ing. "He's '466' '58''968'," '50' cried. "It's un'17't'nate Stiggs d'63' '118' '158' t'43' '547' an'173' '893'erpane—God pity '90' '719' m'173'!—it '76' be '4' ruin of my ho'364'. Has '4' '719' lad a '434'? W'43''s '7' '283'?—t'43', Betty, go to Snarles '4' Painter, '6' '81' '58' to '684't me a '659', '31'—"no suicides permitted '43', '6' no smoking in '4' parlor;"—'240' as '35' '320' '312' birds at '336'. Kill? The Lord be merciful to '90' ghost! What's '7' noise t'43'? You, '507' '128', avast t'43'!"
And '573' up '180' me, '50' '808' me as I '28' '158' '244'ing to '17'ce '422' '4' '450'.
"I '21' '34'ow it; I '205' '19' my premises spoiled. Go '17' '4' locksmith, t'43''s '63' '39' a mile '83' '43'. But avast!" '966' '49' h'6' in '49' '500'-pocket, "'43''s a key '7''ll fit, I '214'; '123''s '66'." And '31' '7', '50' '391'ed it in '4' lock; '33', alas! Queequeg's supple'508'tal bolt remained un'31'drawn '31'in.
"Have to burst it '422'," '136' I, '6' '28' '573' d'249' '4' en'244' a '105', '17' a '68' '319', '74' '4' l'6''614' '808' at me, '158' vo'768'g I '134' '23' '448' d'249' '49' premises; '33' I tore '83' '49', '6' '31' a sudden bodily rush da'50'd '302' '597' '485' '4' mark.
With a prodigious noise '4' '450' flew '422', '6' '4' knob slamming '485' '4' w'34', '708' '4' p'181'er to '4' ceiling; '6' t'43', '68' heavens! t'43' sat Queequeg, alto'42''49' '494' '6' '968'-collected; '40' in '4' '845' of '4' '267'; squatting on '90' hams, '6' '956' Yojo on '739' of '90' '342'. He '720' '948' '63' '103' nor '4' '173' '103', '33' sat '46' a '324'ved image '31' s'324'ce a '659' of '735'ive '139'.
"Queequeg," '136' I, '45' up to '58', "Queequeg, '11''s '4' '301' '31' '1'?"
"He h'594' '91' a '421'tin' so '34' '183', '129' he?" '136' '4' l'6''614'.
But '34' we '136', '23' a '429' '87' we drag '44' of '58'; I al'344' '577' '46' pushing '58' '118', so as to '397' '90' po'421'ion, '17' it '28' al'344' '155'ler'473', it '562'ed so '684''597'y '6' unnatur'34'y constrained; especi'34'y, as in '34' probability he '97' '91' '812' so '17' up'869'ds of '879' or '606' '520', '45' '111' '327' '90' regular meals.
"'441' Hussey," '136' I, "'86' a'349' at '34' '140'ts; so '224' us, if '1' '142', '6' I '76' '66' to '14' st'868'ge af'807' '302'."
Closing '4' '450' upon '4' l'6''614', I '398'eavo'796' to prevail upon Queequeg to '101' a ch'769'; '33' in vain. T'43' he sat; '6' '34' he '87' do—'17' '34' my polite arts '6' bl'6'ish'508'ts—he '72' '23' '367' a peg, nor '99' a single '429', nor '140' '73' at me, nor '23''972' my presence in '4' s'703'est '103'.
I '683', '147' I, if '14' '51' '999' be a '348' of '90' Ra'721'an; do '69' '692' on '238' hams '7' '103' in '90' native isl'6'. It '259' be so; '89', '30' '348' of '90' creed, I '803'; '35', '98', '123' '58' '426'; '540' '42' up '358'er or '379', no doubt. It '51''t '181' '17' '167', '144' God, '6' '90' Ra'721'an '146' '67's '336' a '407'; '6' I '21' '172' '30' '131' punctual '98'.
I '277' d'249' to supper. After '812' a '192' '75' '919'ening to '4' '192' stories of '96' sailors '94' '97' '22' '67' '83' a plum-pudding voyage, as '69' c'34'ed it ('7' is, a '940' whaling-voyage in a scho'63'r or brig, con'178'd to '4' north of '4' '518', in '4' Atlantic Ocean '146'); '180' '919'ening to '182' plum-puddingers '773' '958'ly el'140' o'clock, I '277' up st'769's to go to '515', '174'ing '538' '115' by '14' '75' Queequeg '259' '658' '19' '561' '90' Ra'721'an to a termination. But no; t'43' he '28' '22' w'43' I '97' '269' '58'; he '97' '23' stir'796' an inch. I began to grow vexed '31' '58'; it '562'ed so d'249''40' '587''759' '6' insane to be '812' t'43' '34' '183' '6' '499' '4' '168' on '90' hams in a '690' '267', '956' a '747' of wood on '90' '342'.
"For heaven's '997', Queequeg, '42' up '6' shake y'119''968'; '42' up '6' '19' '96' supper. You'll starve; '248' '320' y'119''968', Queequeg." But '23' a '429' '64' he reply.
Despai'847' of '58', t'43''17'e, I deter'462'd to go to '515' '6' to '503'; '6' no doubt, '165' a '164' '313', he '72' '858' me. But previous to '391'ing in, I '111'k my heavy bearskin jacket, '6' threw it '118' '58', as it '449'd to be a '131' '690' '168'; '6' he '97' no'124' '33' '90' ordinary round jacket on. For '96' '75', do '34' I '72', I '87' '23' '42' '155' '4' fain'704' doze. I '97' bl'249' '44' '4' '51'dle; '6' '4' mere '147' of Queequeg—'23' '492' '908' '141'—'812' t'43' in '7' un'454' po'421'ion, stark al'63' in '4' '690' '6' '967'; '14' '721'e me re'34'y wretched. Think of it; '503'ing '34' '168' in '4' '276' '267' '31' a wide a'830' pagan on '90' hams in '14' dreary, unac'893''473' Ra'721'an!
But '96''60' I '705'ped '141' at '181', '6' k'212' no'124' '117' '773' '448' of '183'; '74', '262' '118' '4' '515''500', t'43' squatted Queequeg, as if he '97' '91' screwed d'249' to '4' '983'. But as '358' as '4' '171' glimpse of sun ente'796' '4' '768'dow, up he '61', '31' stiff '6' grating joints, '33' '31' a cheerful '73'; limped to'869'ds me w'43' I lay; pressed '90' '17'e'342' '158' '485' '462'; '6' '136' '90' Ra'721'an '28' '118'.
Now, as I '165' hinted, I '19' no objection to '138' '369''s religion, be it '11' it '289', so '192' as '7' '369' '185' '23' '320' or insult '138' '173' '369', beca'364' '7' '173' '369' '21' '172' it '516'. But '74' a '128''s religion be'67's re'34'y f'868'tic; '74' it is a po'421'ive tor'508't to '58'; '6', in '178', '408' '14' '987' of '119's an uncom'17't'473' inn to lodge in; '98' I '54' it '530' '75' to '101' '7' individual a'500' '6' argue '4' '378' '31' '58'.
And '22' so I '56' '64' '31' Queequeg. "Queequeg," '136' I, "'42' '155' '515' '56', '6' '596' '6' '919'en to me." I '98' '277' on, beginning '31' '4' rise '6' progress of '4' primitive religions, '6' '260' d'249' to '4' various religions of '4' '986' '75', du'847' '265' '75' I labo'796' to s'60' Queequeg '7' '34' '182' Lents, Ra'721'ans, '6' pro'192'ed ham-squattings in '690', cheer'759' '267's '85' stark non'587'; '217' '17' '4' health; '364''759' '17' '4' soul; opposed, in '940', to '4' obvious '749's of Hygiene '6' common '587'. I '163' '58', '111', '7' he '213' in '173' '124's '375' an extremely sensible '6' sagacious savage, it '684'ed me, '131' '217'ly '684'ed me, to '66' '58' '56' so deplorably foolish '39' '14' ridiculous Ra'721'an of '90'. Be'500's, argued I, '692'ing '408' '4' '618' cave in; hence '4' spirit caves in; '6' '34' '147's born of a '692' '259' necessarily be '499'-starved. T'90' is '4' '385' '65' '344' dyspeptic religionists c'49'ish '375' melancholy '23'ions '39' '238' '43''180's. In '63' '429', Queequeg, '136' I, '743' digressively; '245' is an '256' '171' born on an undigested apple-dumpling; '6' '317' '98' perpetuated '209' '4' '43'ditary dyspepsias nurtu'796' by Ra'721'ans.
I '98' '257'ed Queequeg whe'4'r he '58''968' '28' '167' '461'd '31' dyspepsia; expressing '4' '256' '131' plainly, so '7' he '87' '101' it in. He '136' no; '146' upon '63' memor'473' occasion. It '28' '180' a '164' feast '145'n by '90' '233' '4' king, on '4' gaining of a '164' battle w'43'in fifty of '4' enemy '97' '91' '466' by '39' '149' o'clock in '4' '180'noon, '6' '34' cooked '6' ea'606' '7' '131' '140'ing.
"No '117', Queequeg," '136' I, shudde'847'; "'7' '76' do;" '17' I k'212' '4' inferences '327' '90' fur'4'r hinting '116'. I '97' '333' a sailor '94' '97' vi'421'ed '7' '131' isl'6', '6' he '163' me '7' it '28' '4' custom, '74' a '164' battle '97' '91' gained t'43', to '960'becue '34' '4' slain in '4' yard or garden of '4' victor; '6' '98', '63' by '63', '69' '85' '226'd in '164' wooden trenc'49's, '6' garni'50'd round '46' a pilau, '31' b'504'fruit '6' cocoanuts; '6' '31' '96' parsley in '238' '843's, '85' '708' round '31' '4' victor's compli'508'ts to '34' '90' fri'398's, '22' as '463' '182' '986's '85' so '128'y '617' turkeys.
After '34', I do '23' '54' '7' my remarks '39' religion '721'e '137' impression upon Queequeg. Beca'364', in '4' '171' '226', he '96''60' '562'ed dull of hea'847' on '7' '425' subject, un'759' con'500''796' '83' '90' '249' '378' of view; '6', in '4' '347' '226', he '64' '23' '117' '169' '63' third '447'st'6' me, couch my '256's simply as I '72'; '6', fin'34'y, he no doubt '147' he k'212' a '68' '334' '117' '39' '4' '354' religion '169' I '64'. He '720' at me '31' a '563' of condesc'398'ing c'336'rn '6' com'962'ion, as '463' he '147' it a '164' pity '7' '375' a sensible '507' '128' '134' be so '274''759'ly '387' to evangelical pagan piety.
At '181' we rose '6' '926'ed; '6' Queequeg, '409' a prodigiously '374'y '448''692' of c'60'ders of '34' '563's, so '7' '4' l'6''614' '134' '23' '106' '137' profit by '385' of '90' Ra'721'an, we s'34'ied '44' to board '4' Pequod, s'976'e'847' '549', '6' '512'ing '119' teeth '31' hali'33' b'913'.

As we '85' '459'ing d'249' '4' '398' of '4' wharf to'869'ds '4' ship, Queequeg '324'rying '90' harpoon, Captain Peleg in '90' gruff '915' loudly hailed us '83' '90' wigwam, '99'ing he '97' '23' suspected my fri'398' '28' a '51'nibal, '6' fur'4'r'117' announcing '7' he '123' no '51'nibals on board '7' craft, un'759' '69' previously produced '238' '888's.
"What do '1' '80' by '7', Captain Peleg?" '136' I, '56' jumping on '4' bul'869'ks, '6' '568' my comrade st'6'ing on '4' wharf.
"I '80'," he rep'596'd, "he '259' s'60' '90' '888's."
"Yes," '136' Captain Bil'223' in '90' hollow '915', '856'ing '90' '342' '83' '528' Peleg's, '44' of '4' wigwam. "He '259' s'60' '7' '86' converted. Son of '967'ness," he added, '391'ing to Queequeg, "art thou at '986' in communion '31' '138' '917'tian church?"
"Why," '136' I, "'86' a member of '4' '171' Congregational Church." Here be it '136', '7' '128'y tat'111'ed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at '181' '67' to be converted '155' '4' churches.
"First Congregational Church," cried Bil'223', "'11'! '7' worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Cole'128''s '381'ing-ho'364'?" '6' so '99'ing, '409' '44' '90' spectacles, he rub'515' '116' '31' '90' '164' yellow b'6'ana h'6'kerchief, '6' '966' '116' on '131' '324'e'597'y, '246' '44' of '4' wigwam, '6' leaning stiffly '118' '4' bul'869'ks, '111'k a '68' '192' '73' at Queequeg.
"How '192' hath he '91' a member?" he '98' '136', '391'ing to me; "'23' '131' '192', I '743' '214', '507' '128'."
"No," '136' Peleg, "'6' he '129'n't '91' baptized '40' ei'4'r, or it '72' '19' wa'50'd '96' of '7' d'779''s blue '141' '90' '352'."
"Do '81', '56'," cried Bil'223', "is '14' Phi'919'ine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy's '381'ing? I n'167' '282' '58' '45' t'43', '6' I '962' it e'131' Lord's '183'."
"I '21' k'56' '138''124' '39' Deacon Deuteronomy or '90' '381'ing," '136' I; "'34' I k'56' is, '7' Queequeg '43' is a born member of '4' First Congregational Church. He is a deacon '58''968', Queequeg is."
"Young '128'," '136' Bil'223' sternly, "thou art skylarking '31' me—'656' thy'968', thou '507' Hittite. What church dost '4'e '80'? '491' me."
Finding '302' thus '321' pu'50'd, I rep'596'd. "I '80', '284', '4' '276' ancient Catholic Church to '265' '1' '6' I, '6' Captain Peleg t'43', '6' Queequeg '43', '6' '34' of us, '6' e'131' m'173''s '273' '6' soul of us be'192'; '4' '164' '6' '167''181'ing First Congregation of '14' '251' worshipping '296'; we '34' be'192' to '7'; '146' '96' of us c'49'ish '96' queer crotchets no '103's '678'ing '4' gr'6' be'596'f; in '7' we '34' join '524'."
"Spl'972', thou '80''st spl'972' '524'," cried Peleg, dra'768'g '958'er. "Young '128', '322' '166' ship '17' a '376'ionary, '861' of a '17'e-mast h'6'; I n'167' '299' a '166' sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—'65' Fa'4'r Mapple '58''968' '87'n't '942' it, '6' '86' reck'63'd so'559'hing. Come aboard, '67' aboard; n'167' '241' '39' '4' '888's. I '99', '81' Quohog t'43'—'11''s '7' '1' c'34' '58'? '81' Quohog to '761' '549'. By '4' '164' anchor, '11' a harpoon '86' '61' t'43'! '388' '46' '68' '343' '7'; '6' he '627's it '39' '40'. I '99', Quohog, or w'413'ver y'119' '275' is, '64' '1' '167' st'6' in '4' '342' of a whale-boat? '64' '1' '167' strike a fish?"
With'44' '99'ing a '429', Queequeg, in '90' wild '563' of '103', jumped upon '4' bul'869'ks, '83' '98'ce '155' '4' bows of '63' of '4' whale-boats '621'ing to '4' '500'; '6' '98' bracing '90' '269' knee, '6' poising '90' harpoon, cried '44' in '96' '375' '103' as '14':—
"Cap'ain, '1' '66' '58' sm'34' '705' tar on '604' dere? You '66' '58'? '35', spose '58' '63' whale '784', '35', den!" '6' '409' sharp aim at it, he darted '4' iron '40' '118' '261' Bil'223''s b'937' brim, '817' across '4' ship's decks, '6' struck '4' g'919'ening tar spot '44' of sight.
"Now," '136' Queequeg, '935'ly hauling in '4' '518', "spos-ee '58' whale-e '784'; '65', '223' whale '314'."
"Quick, Bil'223'," '136' Peleg, '90' '348'ner, '94', ag'129't at '4' '452' vicinity of '4' f'666' harpoon, '97' retr'545'ed to'869'ds '4' cabin gang'103'. "Quick, I '99', '1' Bil'223', '6' '42' '4' ship's '888's. We '259' '19' Hedgehog t'43', I '80' Quohog, in '63' of '119' boats. Look ye, Quohog, '221' '145' ye '4' ninetieth lay, '6' '55' '117' '169' '167' '28' '145'n a harpo'63'er '332' '44' of Nantucket."
So d'249' we '277' '155' '4' cabin, '6' to my '164' joy Queequeg '28' '358' enrolled among '4' '276' ship's '624' to '265' I '302' be'192'ed.
When '34' preliminaries '85' '118' '6' Peleg '97' '61' e'131''124' '325' '17' '659'ing, he '391'ed to me '6' '136', "I '214', Quohog t'43' '21' k'56' '60' to '863', '185' he? I '99', Quohog, b'181' ye! dost thou '659' thy '275' or '106' thy mark?"
But at '14' '455', Queequeg, '94' '97' tw'972' or thr'972' '165' '645' '348' in similar ceremonies, '720' no '103's aba'50'd; '33' '409' '4' '141'e'796' pen, copied upon '4' '888', in '4' proper '226', an ex'735' '893'er'348' of a queer round '575' '265' '28' tat'111'ed upon '90' arm; so '7' '209' Captain Peleg's obstinate mis'101' '678'ing '90' appellative, it s'111'd so'559'hing '46' '14':—
Quohog. '90' X mark.
Mean'313' Captain Bil'223' sat earnestly '6' stead'692'ly '784'ing Queequeg, '6' at '181' rising solemnly '6' fumbling in '4' huge pockets of '90' b'937'-skirted drab coat, '111'k '44' a bundle of tr'735's, '6' selecting '63' entitled "The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose," '226'd it in Queequeg's '524', '6' '98' grasping '116' '6' '4' '560' '31' '312' '90', '720' earnestly '155' '90' '495', '6' '136', "Son of '967'ness, I '259' do my duty by '4'e; I am '348' '249'er of '14' ship, '6' '174' '936' '17' '4' souls of '34' '716' crew; if thou s'773' clingest to thy Pagan '103's, '265' I sadly fear, I be'66'ch '4'e, remain '23' '17' aye a Belial bonds'128'. Spurn '4' idol Bell, '6' '4' hideous dr'414'n; '391' '83' '4' wrath to '67'; '241' thine '784', I '99'; oh! '68'ness gracious! steer '574' of '4' fiery pit!"
So'559'hing of '4' salt sea '332' linge'796' in '261' Bil'223''s language, heterogeneously mixed '31' Scriptural '6' domestic phrases.
"Avast t'43', avast t'43', Bil'223', avast '56' spoiling '119' harpo'63'er," cried Peleg. "Pious harpo'63'ers n'167' '106' '68' voyagers—it '726' '4' shark '44' of '514'; no harpo'63'er is '736' a straw '94' aint '281' sharkish. T'43' '28' '507' Nat Swaine, '336' '4' bravest boat-'342'er '44' of '34' Nantucket '6' '4' Vineyard; he joined '4' '381'ing, '6' n'167' '246' to '68'. He '61' so frigh'606'ed '39' '90' pla'191' soul, '7' he shrinked '6' '50'e'796' '170' '83' whales, '17' fear of '180'-claps, in '390' he '61' stove '6' '277' to Davy J'913'."
"Peleg! Peleg!" '136' Bil'223', lifting '90' '495' '6' '524', "thou thy'968', as I '302', '129't '333' '128'y a perilous '75'; thou k'56'est, Peleg, '11' it is to '19' '4' fear of '548'; '60', '98', '51''st thou prate in '14' un'152'ly guise. Thou be'596'st thine '249' '374', Peleg. Tell me, '74' '14' '276' Pequod '43' '97' '49' '291' masts '118'board in '7' typhoon on Japan, '7' '276' voyage '74' thou '277' mate '31' Captain Ahab, '64''st thou '23' '54' of D'545'h '6' '4' Judg'508't '98'?"
"Hear '58', '230' '58' '56'," cried Peleg, marching across '4' cabin, '6' thrusting '90' '524' '458' d'249' '155' '90' pockets,—"'230' '58', '34' of ye. Think of '7'! When e'131' mo'508't we '147' '4' ship '72' sink! D'545'h '6' '4' Judg'508't '98'? What?

Bil'223' '136' no '117', '33' '33'toning up '90' coat, s'649' on deck, w'43' we '858'ed '58'. T'43' he s'111'd, '131' '935'ly '118''262' '96' sail'106'rs '94' '85' '508'ding a '739'-sail in '4' waist. Now '6' '98' he s'111'ped to '512' up a patch, or '550' an '398' of tar'796' t'768'e, '265' '173'wise '240' '19' '91' '28'ted.




CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.

"Shipmates, '19' ye shipped in '7' ship?"
Queequeg '6' I '97' '22' '269' '4' Pequod, '6' '85' s'976'e'847' '170' '83' '4' '604', '17' '4' mo'508't '356' occupied '31' '90' '249' '147's, '74' '4' above '429's '85' '186' to us by a st'868'ger, '94', pa'970' '165' us, levelled '90' m'652'ive '17'efinger at '4' vessel in '455'. He '28' '33' shabbily app'36'lled in faded jacket '6' patched trowsers; a rag of a '751' h'6'kerchief investing '90' neck. A confluent sm'34'-pox '97' in '34' directions fl'969'd '118' '90' '352', '6' '269' it '46' '4' complicated rib'515' '515' of a torrent, '74' '4' rushing '604's '19' '91' dried up.
"Have ye shipped in '49'?" he rep'545'ed.
"You '80' '4' ship Pequod, I '803'," '136' I, '244'ing to gain a '105' '117' '75' '17' an uninterrupted '73' at '58'.
"Aye, '4' Pequod—'7' ship t'43'," he '136', dra'768'g '78' '90' '251' arm, '6' '98' rapidly shoving it '688' '44' '83' '58', '31' '4' '950'ed bay'63't of '90' '378'ed finger darted '597' at '4' object.
"Yes," '136' I, "we '19' '22' '659'ed '4' articles."
"Any'124' d'249' t'43' '39' y'119' souls?"
"Ab'44' '11'?"
"Oh, '760' '1' hav'n't '61' '138'," he '136' quickly. "No '301' '463', I k'56' '128'y chaps '7' hav'n't '61' '138',—'68' '672' to '514'; '6' '69' '36' '34' '4' '166' '141' '17' it. A soul's a '563' of a fifth wheel to a w'414'n."
"What '36' '1' jabbe'847' '39', shipmate?" '136' I.
"He's '61' '243', '463', to '106' up '17' '34' deficiencies of '7' '563' in '173' chaps," abruptly '136' '4' st'868'ger, placing a nervous emp'129'is upon '4' '429' he.
"Queequeg," '136' I, "'123''s go; '14' '947'ow '129' '785'n loose '83' '96'w'43'; '86' '150'ing '39' so'559'hing '6' '96''618' we '21' k'56'."
"S'739'!" cried '4' st'868'ger. "Ye '136' '354'—ye hav'n't '333' Old Th'447' '332', '19' ye?"
"Who's Old Th'447'?" '136' I, '158' riveted '31' '4' insane earnestness of '90' '128'ner.
"Captain Ahab."
"What! '4' captain of '119' ship, '4' Pequod?"
"Aye, among '96' of us '261' sailor chaps, he '547' by '7' '275'. Ye hav'n't '333' '58' '332', '19' ye?"
"No, we hav'n't. He's '541' '69' '99', '33' is '42'ting '166', '6' '76' be '34' '40' '158' '165' '192'."
"All '40' '158' '165' '192'!" laughed '4' st'868'ger, '31' a solemnly derisive '563' of laugh. "Look ye; '74' Captain Ahab is '34' '40', '98' '14' '269' arm of '462' '76' be '34' '40'; '23' '165'."
"What do '1' k'56' '39' '58'?"
"What '64' '69' '81' '1' '39' '58'? Say '7'!"
"T'84' '64'n't '81' '137' of '138''124' '39' '58'; '146' '114' '299' '7' '86' a '68' whale-hunter, '6' a '68' captain to '90' crew."
"That's '354', '55' '354'—'89', '312' '354' '243'. But '1' '259' jump '74' he '145's an '619'. Step '6' growl; growl '6' go—'55' '4' '429' '31' Captain Ahab. But no'124' '39' '7' '124' '7' '203' to '58' '141' Cape Horn, '192' '414', '74' he lay '46' '314' '17' '291' '433' '6' '168's; no'124' '39' '7' '314'ly skrimmage '31' '4' Spaniard a'17'e '4' altar in Santa?—'299' no'124' '39' '7', eh? No'124' '39' '4' silver calabash he spat '155'? And no'124' '39' '90' losing '90' leg '181' voyage, according to '4' prophecy. Didn't ye '230' a '429' '39' '116' '301's '6' so'559'hing '117', eh? No, I '21' '54' ye '64'; '60' '87' ye? Who '359' it? Not '34' Nantucket, I '214'. But '60's''167', '289'hap, ye've '299' '81' '39' '4' leg, '6' '60' he '387' it; aye, ye '19' '299' of '7', I d'36' '99'. Oh '89', '7' e'131' '63' '359' a''344'—I '80' '69' k'56' '86' '146' '63' leg; '6' '7' a parmacetti '111'k '4' '173' '141'."
"My fri'398'," '136' I, "'11' '34' '14' gibberish of y'119's is '39', I '21' k'56', '6' I '21' '137' '324'e; '17' it '562's to me '7' '1' '259' be a '105' damaged in '4' '342'. But if '1' '36' '613'ing of Captain Ahab, of '7' ship t'43', '4' Pequod, '98' '123' me '81' '1', '7' I k'56' '34' '39' '4' loss of '90' leg."
"All '39' it, eh—'115' '1' do?—'34'?"
"Pretty '115'."
With finger '378'ed '6' '784' levelled at '4' Pequod, '4' beggar-'46' st'868'ger s'111'd a mo'508't, as if in a '461'd r'167'ie; '98' '319'ing a '105', '391'ed '6' '136':—"Ye've shipped, '19' ye? Names d'249' on '4' '888's? Well, '35', '11''s '659'ed, is '659'ed; '6' '11''s to be, '76' be; '6' '98' '158', '760' it '205' be, '180' '34'.

Morning to ye, shipmates, '339'; '4' ineff'473' heavens b'759' ye; '16' '120' I '188'ped ye."
"Look '43', fri'398'," '136' I, "if '1' '19' '138''124' '425' to '81' us, '44' '31' it; '33' if '1' '36' '146' '244'ing to bamboozle us, '1' '36' mis'645' in y'119' '544'; '55' '34' I '19' to '99'."
"And '30' '136' '131' '35', '6' I '46' to '230' a chap '150' up '7' '103'; '1' '36' '22' '4' '128' '17' '58'—'4' '46's of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates, '339'! Oh! '74' ye '42' t'43', '81' '514' '114' concluded '23' to '106' '63' of '514'."
"Ah, my '599' '947'ow, '1' '51''t fool us '7' '103'—'1' '51''t fool us. It is '4' easiest '124' in '4' '296' '17' a '128' to '73' as if he '97' a '164' '669' in '58'."
"Morning to ye, shipmates, '339'."
"Morning it is," '136' I. "Come '549', Queequeg, '123''s '224' '14' '419' '128'. But '188', '81' me y'119' '275', '76' '1'?"
"Elijah."
Elijah! '147' I, '6' we '459'ed '170', '312' com'508'ting, '180' '356' '173''s fashion, upon '14' ragged '261' sailor; '6' '897'd '7' he '28' no'124' '33' a humbug, '244'ing to be a bugbear. But we '97' '23' g'63' '760' above a hund'796' yards, '74' chancing to '391' a corner, '6' '262' '78' as I '64' so, '94' '134' be '333' '33' Elijah '858'ing us, '463' at a distance. Some'60', '4' sight of '58' struck me so, '7' I '136' no'124' to Queequeg of '90' '213' '528', '33' '962'ed on '31' my comrade, anxious to '66' whe'4'r '4' st'868'ger '72' '391' '4' '276' corner '7' we '64'. He '64'; '6' '98' it '562'ed to me '7' he '28' '766'ging us, '33' '31' '11' in'606't I '87' '23' '17' '4' '139' of me '805'. T'90' circumstance, '438'd '31' '90' am'201'uous, '499'-hinting, '499'-revealing, shrouded '563' of '150', '56' begat in me '34' '207's of vague '683''508'ts '6' '499'-apprehensions, '6' '34' connected '31' '4' Pequod; '6' Captain Ahab; '6' '4' leg he '97' '387'; '6' '4' Cape Horn fit; '6' '4' silver calabash; '6' '11' Captain Peleg '97' '136' of '58', '74' I '269' '4' ship '4' '183' previous; '6' '4' p'796'iction of '4' squaw Tistig; '6' '4' voyage we '97' bound '119'selves to sail; '6' a hund'796' '173' s'97'owy '124's.
I '28' resolved to satisfy '302' whe'4'r '14' ragged Elijah '28' re'34'y '766'ging us or '23', '6' '31' '7' in'606't crossed '4' '103' '31' Queequeg, '6' on '7' '500' of it retraced '119' '761's. But Elijah '962'ed on, '327' '562'ing to '23''972' us. T'90' re'596'ved me; '6' '336' '117', '6' fin'34'y as it '562'ed to me, I pronounced '58' in my '374', a humbug.




CHAPTER 20. All Astir.

A '183' or '149' '962'ed, '6' t'43' '28' '164' '735'ivity aboard '4' Pequod. Not '146' '85' '4' '261' sails '213' '508'ded, '33' '212' sails '85' '260' on board, '6' bolts of '51'vas, '6' coils of rigging; in '940', e'131''124' '592'okened '7' '4' ship's preparations '85' '906'ing to a '452'. Captain Peleg seldom or n'167' '277' ashore, '33' sat in '90' wigwam '184'ing a sharp '73'-'44' upon '4' '524': Bil'223' '64' '34' '4' purc'129'ing '6' providing at '4' stores; '6' '4' '508' employed in '4' '330' '6' on '4' rigging '85' '406' '773' '192' '180' '168'-f'34'.
On '4' '183' '858'ing Queequeg's '659'ing '4' articles, '429' '28' '145'n at '34' '4' inns w'43' '4' ship's '624' '85' '188'ping, '7' '238' chests '259' be on board '165' '168', '17' t'43' '28' no '361' '60' '358' '4' vessel '240' be sailing. So Queequeg '6' I '61' d'249' '119' traps, resolving, '60''167', to '503' ashore '773' '4' '181'. But it '562's '69' '194' '145' '131' '192' '23''972' in '182' '390's, '6' '4' ship '64' '23' sail '17' s'167'al '433'. But no '683'; t'43' '28' a '68' '334' to be d'63', '6' t'43' is no '361' '60' '128'y '124's to be '147' of, '165' '4' Pequod '28' '597'y equipped.
E'131' '63' '359' '11' a multitude of '124's—'515's, sauce-pans, knives '6' '17'ks, shovels '6' tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, '6' '11' '23', '36' indispens'473' to '4' '355' of ho'364''184'ing. Just so '31' whaling, '265' neces'421'ates a '291'-'266'' ho'364''184'ing upon '4' wide ocean, '458' '83' '34' grocers, costermongers, '456's, bakers, '6' bankers. And '463' '14' '516' '330's '354' of merchant vessels, '332' '23' by '138' '410' to '4' '276' ex'606't as '31' whale'508'. For be'500's '4' '164' length of '4' whaling voyage, '4' numerous articles peculiar to '4' prose'537'ion of '4' fi'50'ry, '6' '4' impossibility of replacing '116' at '4' remote harbors usu'34'y frequented, it '259' be '219'ed, '7' of '34' ships, whaling vessels '36' '4' '344' exposed to '829's of '34' '207's, '6' especi'34'y to '4' destruction '6' loss of '4' '131' '124's upon '265' '4' success of '4' voyage '344' dep'398's. Hence, '4' sp'36' boats, sp'36' spars, '6' sp'36' '518's '6' harpoons, '6' sp'36' e'131''124's, al'344', '33' a sp'36' Captain '6' duplicate ship.
At '4' period of '119' arrival at '4' Isl'6', '4' heaviest storage of '4' Pequod '97' '91' al'344' comp'123'ed; comprising '49' beef, b'504', '604', fuel, '6' iron hoops '6' staves. But, as '165' hinted, '17' '96' '75' t'43' '28' a continual fetching '6' '324'rying on board of divers odds '6' '398's of '124's, '312' large '6' sm'34'.
Chief among '200' '94' '64' '14' fetching '6' '324'rying '28' Captain Bil'223''s '434', a lean '261' '614' of a '344' deter'462'd '6' indefatig'473' spirit, '33' '31'al '131' '207''374'ed, '94' '562'ed resolved '7', if '50' '87' '148' it, no'124' '134' be '295' '53'ing in '4' Pequod, '180' '336' '807'ly '42'ting to sea. At '63' '75' '50' '72' '67' on board '31' a jar of '512'les '17' '4' ste'869'd's pan'244'; an'173' '75' '31' a bunch of quills '17' '4' chief mate's desk, w'43' he '764' '90' log; a third '75' '31' a roll of flannel '17' '4' sm'34' of '96' '63''s rheumatic '78'. N'167' '64' '138' '263' '166' '922' '49' '275', '265' '28' Charity—Aunt Charity, as e'131''618' c'34'ed '49'. And '46' a '434' of '828' '64' '14' charit'473' Aunt Charity bustle '39' '479''49' '6' t'479''49', '325' to '391' '49' h'6' '6' '374' to '138''124' '7' '449'd to yield '564'ty, com'17't, '6' consolation to '34' on board a ship in '265' '49' be'112'd '411' Bil'223' '28' '936', '6' in '265' '50' '916' '249'ed a score or '149' of '35'-'550'd '788'.
But it '28' '319'ling to '66' '14' excellent '374'ed Quakeress '260' on board, as '50' '64' '4' '181' '183', '31' a '192' oil-ladle in '63' h'6', '6' a s'773' '192'er whaling lance in '4' '173'. Nor '28' Bil'223' '58''968' nor Captain Peleg at '34' '78''869'd. As '17' Bil'223', he '324'ried '39' '31' '58' a '192' '919' of '4' articles '643', '6' at e'131' fresh arrival, d'249' '277' '90' mark oppo'421'e '7' article upon '4' '888'. E'131' '336' in a '313' Peleg '246' hobbling '44' of '90' whaleb'63' den, roa'847' at '4' '508' d'249' '4' hatch'103's, roa'847' up to '4' riggers at '4' mast-'342', '6' '98' concluded by roa'847' '78' '155' '90' wigwam.
Du'847' '182' '433' of preparation, Queequeg '6' I of'606' vi'421'ed '4' craft, '6' as of'606' I '257'ed '39' Captain Ahab, '6' '60' he '28', '6' '74' he '28' '45' to '67' on board '90' ship. To '182' '681' '69' '72' '491', '7' he '28' '42'ting '166' '6' '166', '6' '28' '741'ed aboard e'131' '183'; '588'ime, '4' '149' captains, Peleg '6' Bil'223', '87' at'606'd to e'131''124' necessary to fit '4' vessel '17' '4' voyage. If I '97' '91' d'249''40' h'913't '31' '302', I '72' '19' '333' '131' plainly in my '374' '7' I '64' '33' '499' fancy '213' committed '14' '103' to so '192' a voyage, '327' '336' laying my '495' on '4' '128' '94' '28' to be '4' absolute dictator of it, so '358' as '4' ship sailed '44' upon '4' '422' sea. But '74' a '128' suspects '138' '208', it so'559'imes '308's '7' if he be '287' '745' in '4' '301', he insensibly strives to c'118' up '90' suspicions '140' '83' '58''968'. And '137' '14' '103' it '28' '31' me. I '136' no'124', '6' '457' to '54' no'124'.
At '181' it '28' '145'n '44' '7' '96' '75' '290' '183' '4' ship '72' '658' sail. So '290' '339', Queequeg '6' I '111'k a '131' '865' '319'.




CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.

It '28' '958'ly '578' o'clock, '33' '146' grey im'475' misty dawn, '74' we drew nigh '4' wharf.
"T'43' '36' '96' sailors '573' '531' t'43', if I '66' '40'," '136' I to Queequeg, "it '51''t be s'97'ows; s'86' '141' by sunrise, I '214'; '67' on!"
"Avast!" cried a '915', '94'se '249'er at '4' '276' '75' '260' '452' '528' us, laid a h'6' upon '312' '119' '134'ers, '6' '98' insinuating '58''968' '592'ween us, s'111'd s'111'ping '17''869'd a '105', in '4' un'979' twi'703', st'868'gely pee'847' '83' Queequeg to me. It '28' Elijah.
"Going aboard?"
"H'6's '141', '76' '1'," '136' I.
"Lookee '43'," '136' Queequeg, shaking '58''968', "go ''103'!"
"Ain't '45' aboard, '98'?"
"Yes, we '36'," '136' I, "'33' '11' '355' is '7' of y'119's? Do '1' k'56', '197' Elijah, '7' I con'500'r '1' a '105' impertinent?"
"No, no, no; I '237' aw'36' of '7'," '136' Elijah, slowly '6' '909'ly '262' '83' me to Queequeg, '31' '4' '344' unac'893''473' glances.
"Elijah," '136' I, "'1' '76' oblige my fri'398' '6' me by '31'dra'768'g. We '36' '45' to '4' Indian '6' Pacific Oceans, '6' '72' prefer '23' to be detained."
"Ye be, be ye? Coming '78' a'17'e '448''692'?"
"He's cracked, Queequeg," '136' I, "'67' on."
"Holloa!" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us '74' we '97' re'367'd a '360' paces.
"N'167' '241' '58'," '136' I, "Queequeg, '67' on."
But he stole up to us '158', '6' suddenly clapping '90' h'6' on my '134'er, '136'—"Did ye '66' '138''124' '262' '46' '508' '45' to'869'ds '7' ship a '313' '414'?"
Struck by '14' plain '301'-of-'418' '455', I '491'ed, '99'ing, "Yes, I '147' I '64' '66' '492' or '401' '508'; '33' it '28' '111' dim to be '115'."
"Very dim, '131' dim," '136' Elijah. "Morning to ye."
Once '117' we quitted '58'; '33' '336' '117' he '246' softly '180' us; '6' '678'ing my '134'er '158', '136', "See if '1' '51' '156' '514' '56', '76' ye?
"Find '94'?"
"Morning to ye! '339' to ye!" he rejoined, '158' '772' '141'. "Oh! I '28' '45' to '869'n ye '485'—'33' n'167' '241', n'167' '241'—'30' '34' '63', '34' in '4' '250' '111';—sharp frost '14' '339', '594' it? Good-'370' to ye. Shan't '66' ye '158' '131' '358', I '214'; un'759' '30' '165' '4' Gr'6' Jury." And '31' '182' cracked '429's he fin'34'y de'348'ed, '568' me, '17' '4' mo'508't, in no sm'34' '683''508't at '90' f'868'tic impudence.
At '181', '761'ping on board '4' Pequod, we '295' e'131''124' in pro'295' '935', '23' a soul '772'. The cabin ent'868'ce '28' locked '31'in; '4' hatches '85' '34' on, '6' lumbe'796' '31' coils of rigging. Going '17''869'd to '4' '17'ecastle, we '295' '4' slide of '4' s'537'tle '422'. Seeing a '703', we '277' d'249', '6' '295' '146' an '261' rigger t'43', wrapped in a tatte'796' pea-jacket. He '28' '687'n at '251' length upon '149' chests, '90' '352' d'249''869'ds '6' in'452'd in '90' f'261'ed arms. The pro'295'est slumber slept upon '58'.
"Those sailors we '282', Queequeg, w'43' '51' '69' '19' g'63' to?" '136' I, '262' dubiously at '4' '503'er. But it '562'ed '7', '74' on '4' wharf, Queequeg '97' '23' at '34' '23''972'd '11' I '56' '34'uded to; hence I '72' '19' '147' '302' to '19' '91' optic'34'y deceived in '7' '301', '85' it '23' '17' Elijah's '173'wise inexplic'473' '455'. But I '942' '4' '124' d'249'; '6' '158' marking '4' '503'er, jocularly hinted to Queequeg '7' '760' we '97' '258' '421' up '31' '4' '618'; '361' '58' to establish '58''968' accordingly. He '186' '90' h'6' upon '4' '503'er's rear, as '463' '174'ing if it '28' soft '243'; '6' '98', '327' '117' ado, sat '935'ly d'249' t'43'.
"Gracious! Queequeg, '21' '421' t'43'," '136' I.
"Oh! perry dood s'545'," '136' Queequeg, "my '893'ry '103'; '205' '310' '58' '352'."
"Face!" '136' I, "c'34' '7' '90' '352'? '131' benevolent coun'606'ance '98'; '33' '60' '321' he brea'4's, '86' heaving '58''968'; '42' '141', Queequeg, '1' '36' heavy, '30' grinding '4' '352' of '4' '719'. Get '141', Queequeg! Look, '540' twitch '1' '141' '358'. I '683' he '21' '830'."
Queequeg re'367'd '58''968' to '22' beyond '4' '342' of '4' '503'er, '6' '703'ed '90' tomahawk pipe. I sat at '4' '908'. We '764' '4' pipe '962'ing '118' '4' '503'er, '83' '63' to '4' '173'. Mean'313', upon '455'ing '58' in '90' '785'n fashion, Queequeg '417' me to '447'st'6' '7', in '90' l'6', o'768'g to '4' absence of '451'tees '6' sofas of '34' '563's, '4' king, chiefs, '6' '164' '151' gener'34'y, '85' in '4' custom of fat'606'ing '96' of '4' l'969'r '619's '17' otto'128's; '6' to furnish a ho'364' com'17'tably in '7' '952', '1' '97' '146' to '610' up '879' or '606' lazy '947'ows, '6' lay '116' round in '4' piers '6' alcoves. Be'500's, it '28' '131' convenient on an excursion; '137' '166' '169' '200' garden-ch'769's '265' '36' convertible '155' '459'ing-'856's; upon occasion, a chief c'34'ing '90' at'606'dant, '6' de'284'ing '58' to '106' a '451'tee of '58''968' '447' a sp'504'ing tree, '760' in '96' damp marshy '226'.
While narrating '182' '124's, e'131' '75' Queequeg received '4' tomahawk '83' me, he fl'119'i'50'd '4' hatchet-'500' of it '118' '4' '503'er's '342'.
"What's '7' '17', Queequeg?"
"Perry '454', '320'-e; oh! perry '454'!"
He '28' '45' on '31' '96' wild reminiscences '39' '90' tomahawk-pipe, '265', it '562'ed, '97' in '716' '149' '364's '312' brained '90' foes '6' soo'4'd '90' soul, '74' we '85' directly attr'735'ed to '4' '503'ing rigger. The '777' vap'119' '56' comp'123'ely filling '4' contr'735'ed hole, it began to '81' upon '58'. He brea'4'd '31' a '563' of muffledness; '98' '562'ed '461'd in '4' nose; '98' revolved '118' '336' or tw'972'; '98' sat up '6' rub'515' '90' '495'.
"Holloa!" he brea'4'd at '181', "'94' be ye smokers?"
"Shipped '508'," '491'ed I, "'74' '185' '50' sail?"
"Aye, aye, ye '36' '45' in '49', be ye? She sails to-'183'. The Captain '246' aboard '181' '168'."
"What Captain?—Ahab?"
"Who '33' '58' indeed?"
I '28' '45' to '257' '58' '96' fur'4'r '681' c'336'rning Ahab, '74' we '299' a noise on deck.
"Holloa! Starbuck's astir," '136' '4' rigger. "He's a '349'ly chief mate, '7'; '68' '128', '6' a pious; '33' '34' a'349' '56', I '259' '391' to." And so '99'ing he '277' on deck, '6' we '858'ed.
It '28' '56' '574' sunrise. Soon '4' crew '246' on board in '149's '6' '291's; '4' riggers '258'ir'796' '116'selves; '4' mates '85' '735'ively engaged; '6' s'167'al of '4' shore '151' '85' '748' in b'847'ing various '181' '124's on board.

At length, to'869'ds noon, upon '4' final dis'376'al of '4' ship's riggers, '6' '180' '4' Pequod '97' '91' hauled '44' '83' '4' wharf, '6' '180' '4' '167'-'147'ful Charity '97' '67' '141' in a whale-boat, '31' '49' '181' '964'—a '168'-cap '17' Stubb, '4' '347' mate, '49' '411'-in-'749', '6' a sp'36' Bible '17' '4' ste'869'd—'180' '34' '14', '4' '149' Captains, Peleg '6' Bil'223', issued '83' '4' cabin, '6' '391'ing to '4' chief mate, Peleg '136':
"Now, '197' Starbuck, '36' '1' '115' e'131''124' is '40'? Captain Ahab is '34' '325'—'22' spoke to '58'—no'124' '117' to be '61' '83' shore, eh? Well, c'34' '34' '524', '98'. Muster '514' aft '43'—b'181' '514'!"
"No '107' of profane '429's, '60''167' '164' '4' '906', Peleg," '136' Bil'223', "'33' '170' '31' '4'e, fri'398' Starbuck, '6' do '119' bidding."
How '56'! Here upon '4' '131' '378' of '319'ing '17' '4' voyage, Captain Peleg '6' Captain Bil'223' '85' '45' it '31' a '530' h'6' on '4' quarter-deck, '22' as if '69' '85' to be joint-com'128'ders at sea, as '35' as to '34' appea'868'ces in port. And, as '17' Captain Ahab, no '659' of '58' '28' '332' to be '333'; '146', '69' '136' he '28' in '4' cabin. But '98', '4' '256' '28', '7' '90' presence '28' by no '410' necessary in '42'ting '4' ship '447' weigh, '6' stee'847' '49' '35' '44' to sea. Indeed, as '7' '28' '23' at '34' '90' proper '355', '33' '4' pi'202''s; '6' as he '28' '23' '332' comp'123'ely rec'118'ed—so '69' '136'—t'43''17'e, Captain Ahab '235'ed below. And '34' '14' '562'ed natural '243'; especi'34'y as in '4' merchant serv'972' '128'y captains n'167' s'60' '116'selves on deck '17' a con'500'r'473' '75' '180' heaving up '4' anchor, '33' remain '118' '4' cabin t'473', '305' a f'36''35' merry-'380' '31' '238' shore fri'398's, '165' '69' quit '4' ship '17' '68' '31' '4' pi'202'.
But t'43' '28' '23' '137' '365' to '54' '118' '4' '301', '17' Captain Peleg '28' '56' '34' a'349'. He '562'ed to do '344' of '4' '150'ing '6' com'128'ding, '6' '23' Bil'223'.
"Aft '43', ye '273's of bachelors," he cried, as '4' sailors linge'796' at '4' main-mast. "'197' Starbuck, '698''514' aft."
"Strike '4' '606't t'43'!"—'28' '4' '290' '619'. As I hinted '165', '14' whaleb'63' marquee '28' n'167' pitched '722' in port; '6' on board '4' Pequod, '17' thirty '266', '4' '619' to strike '4' '606't '28' '35' '677' to be '4' '290' '124' to heaving up '4' anchor.
"Man '4' capstan! Blood '6' th'447'!—jump!"—'28' '4' '290' com'128'd, '6' '4' crew sp'868'g '17' '4' '524'pikes.
Now in '42'ting '447' weigh, '4' station gener'34'y occupied by '4' pi'202' is '4' '17''869'd '348' of '4' ship. And '43' Bil'223', '94', '31' Peleg, be it '677', in addition to '90' '173' '493'rs, '28' '63' of '4' l'972'nsed pi'202's of '4' port—he '213' suspected to '19' '61' '58''968' '721'e a pi'202' in '619' to '550' '4' Nantucket pi'202'-fee to '34' '4' ships he '28' '936' in, '17' he n'167' pi'202'ed '138' '173' craft—Bil'223', I '99', '240' '56' be '333' '735'ively engaged in '262' '118' '4' bows '17' '4' approaching anchor, '6' at intervals singing '11' '562'ed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer '4' '524' at '4' '768'dl'652', '94' roa'796' '17'th '96' '563' of a chorus '39' '4' '641' in Booble Alley, '31' '374'y '68' '76'. N'167''4''759', '23' '291' '433' previous, Bil'223' '97' '163' '116' '7' no profane '273'gs '72' be '34''969'd on board '4' Pequod, '348'icularly in '42'ting '447' weigh; '6' Charity, '90' '434', '97' '226'd a sm'34' '667' copy of Watts in '356' sea'128''s berth.
Mean'75', '118''66'ing '4' '173' '348' of '4' ship, Captain Peleg ripped '6' swore astern in '4' '344' f'40'ful '128'ner. I al'344' '147' he '72' sink '4' ship '165' '4' anchor '87' be '61' up; involuntarily I pa'364'd on my '524'pike, '6' '163' Queequeg to do '4' '276', '54'ing of '4' perils we '312' '868', in '319'ing on '4' voyage '31' '375' a d'779' '17' a pi'202'. I '28' com'17'ting '302', '60''167', '31' '4' '147' '7' in pious Bil'223' '240' be '295' '96' salvation, spite of '90' s'140' hund'796' '6' s'140'ty-s'140'th lay; '74' I '577' a sudden sharp poke in my rear, '6' '391'ing round, '28' horrified at '4' apparition of Captain Peleg in '4' '735' of '31'dra'768'g '90' leg '83' my immediate vicinity. That '28' my '171' kick.
"Is '7' '4' '103' '69' heave in '4' marchant serv'972'?" he roa'796'. "Sp'847', thou '50'ep-'342'; sp'847', '6' '448' thy '78'b'63'! Why '21' ye sp'847', I '99', '34' of ye—sp'847'! Quohog! sp'847', thou chap '31' '4' '796' w'90'kers; sp'847' t'43', Scotch-cap; sp'847', thou green pants. Sp'847', I '99', '34' of ye, '6' sp'847' y'119' '495' '44'!" And so '99'ing, he '367'd '549' '4' '768'dl'652', '43' '6' t'43' '970' '90' leg '131' '523'ly, '313' imperturb'473' Bil'223' '764' leading '141' '31' '90' psalmody. Thinks I, Captain Peleg '259' '19' '91' '580'ing so'559'hing to-'183'.
At '181' '4' anchor '28' up, '4' sails '85' '451', '6' '141' we glided. It '28' a '940', '690' '617'; '6' as '4' '940' nor'4'rn '183' merged '155' '168', we '295' '119'selves al'344' b'937' upon '4' '768''244' ocean, '94'se '523'zing spray '390'd us in '972', as in poli'50'd armor. The '192' rows of teeth on '4' bul'869'ks g'919'ened in '4' moon'703'; '6' '46' '4' '691' ivory tusks of '96' huge elephant, vast curving icicles dep'398'ed '83' '4' bows.
Lank Bil'223', as pi'202', '342'ed '4' '171' '430', '6' '167' '6' anon, as '4' '261' craft deep dived '155' '4' green seas, '6' '708' '4' shive'847' frost '34' '118' '49', '6' '4' '768'ds '60'led, '6' '4' cordage '868'g, '90' steady '23'es '85' '299',—
"Sweet fields beyond '4' s'35'ing flood, St'6' '926'ed in '565' green. So to '4' Jews '261' Canaan s'111'd, While Jordan rolled '592'ween."
N'167' '64' '200' '584' '429's '602' '117' '584'ly to me '169' '98'. T'84' '85' '597' of '274' '6' fruition. Spite of '14' frigid '768'ter '168' in '4' boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet '908' '6' wetter jacket, t'43' '28' '332', it '98' '562'ed to me, '128'y a pleasant '19'n in store; '6' meads '6' '431'es so etern'34'y vernal, '7' '4' gr'652' s'576' up by '4' sp'847', untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
At '181' we gained '375' an '141'ing, '7' '4' '149' pi'202's '85' '643' no '192'er. The st'44' sail-boat '7' '97' accompanied us began '868'ging '549''500'.
It '28' curious '6' '23' unpleasing, '60' Peleg '6' Bil'223' '85' affected at '14' juncture, especi'34'y Captain Bil'223'. For loath to de'348', '332'; '131' loath to '224', '17' '68', a ship bound on so '192' '6' perilous a voyage—beyond '312' stormy Capes; a ship in '265' '96' thous'6's of '90' '321' earned '788' '85' invested; a ship, in '265' an '261' shipmate sailed as captain; a '128' al'344' as '261' as he, '336' '117' '319'ing to en'893'er '34' '4' terrors of '4' piti'759' jaw; loath to '99' '68'-'370' to a '124' so e'131' '103' brimful of e'131' inte'426' to '58',—'719' '261' Bil'223' linge'796' '192'; paced '4' deck '31' anxious st'852's; '868' d'249' '155' '4' cabin to '613' an'173' f'36''35' '429' t'43'; '158' '246' on deck, '6' '720' to '768'd'869'd; '720' to'869'ds '4' wide '6' '398''759' '604's, '146' bounded by '4' '458'-'141' un'333' Eastern Continents; '720' to'869'ds '4' l'6'; '720' aloft; '720' '40' '6' '269'; '720' e'131'w'43' '6' '56''43'; '6' at '181', mechanic'34'y coiling a rope upon '716' pin, convulsively grasped st'44' Peleg by '4' h'6', '6' '956' up a lantern, '17' a mo'508't s'111'd gazing '49'oic'34'y in '90' '352', as '137' as to '99', "N'167''4''759', fri'398' Peleg, I '51' st'6' it; '89', I '51'."
As '17' Peleg '58''968', he '111'k it '117' '46' a philosop'49'; '33' '17' '34' '90' philosophy, t'43' '28' a tear t'768'kling in '90' '784', '74' '4' lantern '246' '111' '958'. And he, '111', '64' '23' a '105' '366' '83' cabin to deck—'56' a '429' below, '6' '56' a '429' '31' Starbuck, '4' chief mate.
But, at '181', he '391'ed to '90' comrade, '31' a final '563' of '73' '39' '58',—"Captain Bil'223'—'67', '261' shipmate, we '259' go. Back '4' main-yard t'43'! Boat ahoy! St'6' by to '67' '452' '549''500', '56'! C'36'ful, '324'eful!—'67', Bil'223', '311'—'99' y'119' '181'.

Hurrah '6' '170'!"
"God b'759' ye, '6' '19' ye in His holy '184'ing, '508'," murmu'796' '261' Bil'223', al'344' inco'43'ntly. "I '274' ye'll '19' '178' wea'4'r '56', so '7' Captain Ahab '289' '358' be '772' among ye—a pleasant sun is '34' he '460', '6' ye'll '19' plenty of '116' in '4' tropic voyage ye go. Be '324'eful in '4' hunt, ye mates. Don't stave '4' boats '107''759'ly, ye harpo'63'ers; '68' '691' cedar '519'k is raised '597' '291' per cent. '31'in '4' '407'. Don't '353' y'119' prayers, ei'4'r.

Don't whale it '111' '137' a' Lord's '433', '508'; '33' '21' '376' a '807' '365' ei'4'r, '55' rejecting Heaven's '68' '964's. Have an '784' to '4' mol'652'es tierce, '197' Stubb; it '28' a '105' leaky, I '147'. If ye '678' at '4' isl'6's, '197' Fl'257', bew'36' of '17'nication. Good-'370', '68'-'370'! Don't '184' '7' cheese '111' '192' d'249' in '4' '330', '197' Starbuck; '543' spoil. Be '324'eful '31' '4' '33'ter—t'277'y cents '4' pound it '28', '6' '241' ye, if—"
"Come, '67', Captain Bil'223'; '188' palave'847',—'170'!" '6' '31' '7', Peleg hurried '58' '118' '4' '500', '6' '312' '705't '155' '4' boat.
Ship '6' boat diverged; '4' '690', damp '168' breeze blew '592'ween; a screaming gull flew '118''342'; '4' '149' hulls wildly rolled; we '417' '291' heavy-'374'ed cheers, '6' blindly plunged '46' fate '155' '4' l'63' Atlantic.




CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.

Some chapters '78', '63' Bulkington '28' spoken of, a t'34', '212'l'6'ed mariner, en'893'e'796' in New Bed'17'd at '4' inn.
When on '7' shive'847' '768'ter's '168', '4' Pequod thrust '49' vindictive bows '155' '4' '690' malicious waves, '94' '134' I '66' st'6'ing at '49' helm '33' Bulkington! I '720' '31' sympa'4'tic awe '6' fearfulness upon '4' '128', '94' in mid-'768'ter '22' l'6'ed '83' a '492' '266'' dangerous voyage, '87' so un'426'ingly push '141' '158' '17' s'773' an'173' tempestuous term. The l'6' '562'ed scorching to '90' '908'. Wonder'597'est '124's '36' '167' '4' un'508'tion'473'; deep memories yield no epitaphs; '14' '578'-inch chapter is '4' st'63''759' grave of Bulkington. Let me '146' '99' '7' it fa'796' '31' '58' as '31' '4' storm-tossed ship, '7' miserably '698's '549' '4' lee'869'd l'6'. The port '72' fain '145' succor; '4' port is pitiful; in '4' port is '564'ty, com'17't, '374'hst'63', supper, '869'm blankets, fri'398's, '34' '55' '207' to '119' mortalities. But in '7' gale, '4' port, '4' l'6', is '7' ship's di'426' jeopardy; '50' '259' fly '34' '467'ity; '63' '678' of l'6', '463' it '33' graze '4' keel, '72' '106' '49' shudder '209' '6' '209'. With '34' '49' '240' '50' crowds '34' sail '141' shore; in so '143', '535's 'gainst '4' '131' '768'ds '7' fain '72' blow '49' '179''869'd; '66'ks '34' '4' la'50'd sea's l'6''759'ness '158'; '17' refuge's '997' '17'lornly rushing '155' peril; '49' '146' fri'398' '49' '437'te'426' foe!
K'56' ye '56', Bulkington? Glimpses do ye '562' to '66' of '7' mort'34'y '155'ler'473' '350'; '7' '34' deep, earnest '54'ing is '33' '4' intrepid ef'17't of '4' soul to '184' '4' '422' indep'398'ence of '49' sea; '313' '4' wildest '768'ds of heaven '6' '987' conspire to cast '49' on '4' tr'356'erous, slavish shore?
But as in l'6''759'ness al'63' re'500's '530'est '350', shore'759', indefinite as God—so, '166' is it to perish in '7' '60'ling infinite, '169' be ingloriously da'50'd upon '4' lee, '140' if '7' '85' '564'ty! For worm-'46', '98', oh! '94' '72' craven crawl to l'6'! Terrors of '4' '816'! is '34' '14' '414'ny so vain? Take '374', '101' '374', O Bulkington! Bear '4'e grimly, demi'152'! Up '83' '4' spray of thy ocean-perishing—'688' up, leaps thy apo'4'osis!




CHAPTER 24. The Advocate.

As Queequeg '6' I '36' '56' '807'ly em'960'ked in '14' '355' of whaling; '6' as '14' '355' of whaling '129' '96''60' '67' to be regarded among l'6's'508' as a '743' unpoetical '6' disre'186''473' pursuit; t'43''17'e, I am '34' anxiety to convince ye, ye l'6's'508', of '4' in'22''972' '43'by d'63' to us hunters of whales.
In '4' '171' '226', it '289' be deemed al'344' superfluous to establish '4' '418', '7' among '151' at large, '4' '355' of whaling is '23' ac'893'ed on a level '31' '11' '36' c'34'ed '4' liberal professions.

G'868't it, '317' '1' cite it; '33', '99' '11' '1' '76', t'43' is no '272' dignity in whaling.
No dignity in whaling? The dignity of '119' c'34'ing '4' '131' heavens at'704'. Cetus is a cons'81'ation in '4' S'44'h! No '117'! Drive d'249' y'119' hat in presence of '4' Czar, '6' '101' it '141' to Queequeg! No '117'! I k'56' a '128' '7', in '90' '139''75', '129' '645' '291' hund'796' '6' fifty whales.

CHAPTER 25. Postscript.

In be'499' of '4' dignity of whaling, I '72' fain advance naught '33' substantiated '418's. But '180' embattling '90' '418's, an advocate '94' '134' '94'lly suppress a '23' un'385''473' surmise, '265' '240' '81' eloquently upon '90' ca'364'—'375' an advocate, '72' he '23' be '810''736'y?
It is '35' '677' '7' at '4' coronation of kings '6' queens, '140' modern '913', a '979' curious process of sea'273'ing '116' '17' '238' '427'ctions is g'63' '209'. T'43' is a saltcellar of '892', so c'34'ed, '6' t'43' '289' be a castor of '892'. How '69' '364' '4' salt, precisely—'94' '359'? Certain I am, '60''167', '7' a king's '342' is solemnly oiled at '90' coronation, '140' as a '342' of salad. Can it be, '463', '7' '69' anoint it '31' a view of '380' '716' interior '366' '35', as '69' anoint machinery? Much '240' be ruminated '43', c'336'rning '4' es'708'ial dignity of '14' regal process, beca'364' in common '139' we esteem '33' '80'ly '6' contemptibly a '947'ow '94' anoints '90' h'769', '6' palpably smells of '7' anointing. In '350', a mature '128' '94' '364's h'769'-oil, un'759' medicin'34'y, '7' '128' '129' '307' '61' a quoggy spot in '58' '96'w'43'. As a general rule, he '51''t amount to '137' in '90' totality.
But '4' '146' '124' to be con'500''796' '43', is '14'—'11' '207' of oil is '364'd at coronations? Certainly it '51''23' be o'349' oil, nor mac'652'ar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-'349'r oil. What '98' '51' it '999' be, '33' sperm oil in '716' un'128'u'418'u'796', unpolluted '892', '4' '584'est of '34' oils?
Think of '7', ye loyal Britons! we whale'508' supply y'119' kings '6' queens '31' coronation '343'!




CHAPTER 26. K'168's '6' Squires.

The chief mate of '4' Pequod '28' Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, '6' a Quaker by descent. He '28' a '192', earnest '128', '6' '463' born on an icy coast, '562'ed '35' adapted to '398'ure '576' latitudes, '90' flesh '213' '321' as tw'972'-baked biscuit. T'868'sported to '4' In'474's, '90' '349' '593' '72' '23' spoil '46' bottled ale. He '259' '19' '91' born in '96' '75' of general drought '6' fa'462', or upon '63' of '200' '692' '433' '17' '265' '90' '892' is famous. Only '96' thirty arid summers '97' he '333'; '200' summers '97' dried up '34' '90' physical superfluousness. But '14', '90' thinness, so to '613', '562'ed no '117' '4' token of '28'ting anxieties '6' '324'es, '169' it '562'ed '4' indication of '138' bodily b'703'. It '28' merely '4' condensation of '4' '128'. He '28' by no '410' ill-'262'; '538' '4' contrary. His pure tight skin '28' an excellent fit; '6' '452'ly wrapped up in it, '6' embalmed '31' inner health '6' strength, '46' a revivified Egyptian, '14' Starbuck '562'ed prepa'796' to '398'ure '17' '192' ages to '67', '6' to '398'ure '194', as '56'; '17' be it Polar s'56' or torrid sun, '46' a pa'606't chrono'559'er, '90' interior vitality '28' '869''868'ted to do '35' in '34' climates.

A staid, stead'692' '128', '94'se '139' '17' '4' '344' '348' '28' a '361' pantomime of '735'ion, '6' '23' a tame chapter of '602's. Yet, '17' '34' '90' '321'y sobriety '6' '17'titude, t'43' '85' '979' qualities in '58' '265' at '464' affected, '6' in '96' '390's '562'ed '35' nigh to '118'balance '34' '4' '426'. Uncomm'146' conscientious '17' a sea'128', '6' '398'ued '31' a deep natural r'167'ence, '4' wild '604'y l'63''518'ss of '90' '139' '64' t'43''17'e '777'ly inc'518' '58' to superstition; '33' to '7' '563' of superstition, '265' in '96' organizations '562's '743' to sp'847', '96''60', '83' in'81'igence '169' '83' igno'868'ce. Out'869'd por'606'ts '6' in'869'd '986'i'508'ts '85' '90'. And if at '464' '182' '124's bent '4' welded iron of '90' soul, '137' '117' '64' '90' '458'-'170' domestic memories of '90' '507' Cape '362' '6' '497', '606'd to b'398' '58' s'773' '117' '83' '4' original ruggedness of '90' nature, '6' '422' '58' s'773' fur'4'r to '200' la'606't influences '265', in '96' h'913't-'374'ed '508', '426'rain '4' gush of d'36'-d'779' da'847', so of'606' evinced by '173's in '4' '117' perilous vicis'421'udes of '4' fi'50'ry. "I '76' '19' no '128' in my boat," '136' Starbuck, "'94' is '23' '423' of a whale." By '14', he '562'ed to '80', '23' '146' '7' '4' '344' reli'473' '6' '364'ful c'119'age '28' '7' '265' arises '83' '4' '807' estimation of '4' en'893'e'796' peril, '33' '7' an utterly fear'759' '128' is a '458' '117' dangerous comrade '169' a co'869'd.
"Aye, aye," '136' Stubb, '4' '347' mate, "Starbuck, t'43', is as '324'eful a '128' as '248' '156' '138'w'43' in '14' fi'50'ry." But we sh'34' ere '192' '66' '11' '7' '429' "'324'eful" precisely '410' '74' '364'd by a '128' '46' Stubb, or al'344' '138' '173' whale hunter.
Starbuck '28' no crusader '180' perils; in '58' c'119'age '28' '23' a '708'i'508't; '33' a '124' simply '364'ful to '58', '6' '194' at h'6' upon '34' mort'34'y pr'735'ical occasions. Be'500's, he '147', '760', '7' in '14' '355' of whaling, c'119'age '28' '63' of '4' '164' staple '44'f'716' of '4' ship, '46' '49' beef '6' '49' b'504', '6' '23' to be foolishly '28'ted. W'43''17'e he '97' no fancy '17' l'969''847' '17' whales '180' sun-d'249'; nor '17' persisting in '535'ing a fish '7' '111' '137' persisted in '535'ing '58'. For, '147' Starbuck, I am '43' in '14' critical ocean to '320' whales '17' my '565', '6' '23' to be '466' by '116' '17' '238's; '6' '7' hund'796's of '508' '97' '91' so '466' Starbuck '35' k'212'. What doom '28' '90' '249' '233''s? W'43', in '4' bottom'759' deeps, '87' he '156' '4' torn limbs of '90' '411'?
With memories '46' '182' in '58', '6', '117''118', '145'n to a '979' superstitiousness, as '129' '91' '136'; '4' c'119'age of '14' Starbuck '265' '87', n'167''4''759', s'773' fl'119'ish, '259' indeed '19' '91' extreme. But it '28' '23' in '385''473' nature '7' a '128' so organized, '6' '31' '375' '816' experiences '6' rememb'868'ces as he '97'; it '28' '23' in nature '7' '182' '124's '134' fail in la'606'tly eng'398'e'847' an ele'508't in '58', '265', '447' suit'473' circumstances, '72' '448' '44' '83' '716' con'178''508't, '6' burn '34' '90' c'119'age up. And brave as he '240' be, it '28' '7' '563' of bra'131' chiefly, visible in '96' intrepid '508', '265', '313' gener'34'y abiding firm in '4' conflict '31' seas, or '768'ds, or whales, or '138' of '4' ordinary irrational horrors of '4' '296', '332' '51''23' '31'st'6' '200' '117' terrific, beca'364' '117' spiritual terrors, '265' so'559'imes '508'ace '1' '83' '4' c'336'ntrating brow of an enraged '6' '240'y '128'.
But '85' '4' '260' narrative to reveal in '138' instance, '4' comp'123'e abase'508't of '719' Starbuck's '17'titude, s'324'ce '240' I '19' '4' '374' to '863' it; '17' it is a '124' '344' sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose '4' f'34' of val'119' in '4' soul. Men '289' '562' de'704''473' as joint stock-companies '6' nations; knaves, fools, '6' '776'ers t'43' '289' be; '508' '289' '19' '80' '6' meagre '352's; '33' '128', in '4' '256'l, is so noble '6' so sparkling, '375' a gr'6' '6' glo'768'g cr'545'ure, '7' '118' '138' ignominious blemish in '58' '34' '90' '947'ows '134' '366' to '687' '238' cost'596'st robes. That immacu'399' '128''518'ss we '174' '31'in '119'selves, so '458' '31'in us, '7' it remains int'735' '463' '34' '4' '44'er char'735'er '562' g'63'; bleeds '31' keenest anguish at '4' undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined '128'. Nor '51' piety '716'elf, at '375' a shameful sight, comp'123'ely stifle '49' upbraidings '485' '4' permitting stars. But '14' august dignity I tr'545' of, is '23' '4' dignity of kings '6' robes, '33' '7' abounding dignity '265' '129' no ro'515' investiture. Thou shalt '66' it shining in '4' arm '7' wields a '512' or '698's a spike; '7' democratic dignity '265', on '34' '524', radiates '327' '398' '83' God; Him'968'! The '164' God absolute! The centre '6' circumference of '34' democracy! His omnipresence, '119' divine equality!
If, '98', to '80'est mariners, '6' renegades '6' cast'170's, I sh'34' '43''180' ascribe '530' qualities, '463' '967'; weave round '116' tragic graces; if '140' '4' '344' m'119'nful, per'365' '4' '344' abased, among '116' '34', sh'34' at '464' lift '58''968' to '4' exalted mounts; if I sh'34' '678' '7' '176''128''s arm '31' '96' et'43'al '703'; if I sh'34' sp'504' a rainbow '118' '90' disastrous '451' of sun; '98' '485' '34' mortal critics bear me '44' in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality, '265' '129't sp'504' '63' royal '128'tle of hu'128'ity '118' '34' my '207'!

CHAPTER 27. K'168's '6' Squires.

Stubb '28' '4' '347' mate. He '28' a native of Cape Cod; '6' hence, according to local usage, '28' c'34'ed a Cape-Cod-'128'. A '280'-go-'672'y; '948' craven nor valiant; '409' perils as '69' '246' '31' an in'465' '769'; '6' '313' engaged in '4' '344' im'462'nt crisis of '4' c'129'e, toiling '170', '804' '6' collected as a j'119'ney'128' joiner engaged '17' '4' '407'. Good-hu'117'd, '454', '6' '324'e'759', he pre'500'd '118' '90' whale-boat as if '4' '344' '314'ly en'893'er '85' '33' a '484', '6' '90' crew '34' invited guests. He '28' as '348'icular '39' '4' com'17't'473' ar'868'ge'508't of '90' '348' of '4' boat, as an '261' stage-'698'r is '39' '4' snugness of '90' '990'. When '452' to '4' whale, in '4' '131' '548'-lock of '4' '535', he '627'd '90' unpitying lance '494'ly '6' '141'-h'6'edly, as a w'90'tling tinker '90' hammer. He '72' hum '118' '90' '261' rigadig tunes '313' flank '6' flank '31' '4' '344' exasperated monster. Long usage '97', '17' '14' Stubb, converted '4' jaws of '548' '155' an '454' ch'769'. What he '147' of '548' '716'elf, t'43' is no '361'. Whe'4'r he '167' '147' of it at '34', '240' be a '455'; '33', if he '167' '64' '365' to cast '90' '241' '7' '103' '180' a com'17't'473' '484', no doubt, '46' a '68' sailor, he '111'k it to be a '563' of c'34' of '4' '430' to tumble aloft, '6' '258'ir '116'selves t'43', '39' so'559'hing '265' he '72' '156' '44' '74' he ob'784'd '4' '619', '6' '23' '358'er.
What, '760', '31' '173' '124's, '721'e Stubb '375' an '454'-'45', unfea'847' '128', so cheerily trudging '141' '31' '4' burden of '139' in a '296' '597' of grave pedlars, '34' b'969'd to '4' ground '31' '238' packs; '11' '148'ed to b'847' '39' '7' al'344' impious '68'-humor of '90'; '7' '124' '259' '19' '91' '90' pipe. For, '46' '90' nose, '90' '940', '751' '105' pipe '28' '63' of '4' regular f'545'ures of '90' '352'. You '72' al'344' as '358' '19' '741'ed '58' to '391' '44' of '90' bunk '327' '90' nose as '327' '90' pipe. He '764' a '251' row of pipes t'43' '325' loaded, stuck in a rack, '31'in '454' r'356' of '90' h'6'; '6', '74''167' he '391'ed in, he smoked '116' '34' '44' in succession, '703'ing '63' '83' '4' '173' to '4' '398' of '4' chapter; '98' loading '116' '158' to be in '504'iness a'212'. For, '74' Stubb '926'ed, '861' of '171' '966' '90' legs '155' '90' trowsers, he '186' '90' pipe '155' '90' '843'.
I '99' '14' continual smoking '259' '19' '91' '63' ca'364', at '402', of '90' peculiar dispo'421'ion; '17' e'131' '63' '359' '7' '14' '987'ly '769', whe'4'r ashore or afloat, is terribly infected '31' '4' '275''759' miseries of '4' '539''759' mortals '94' '19' '474'd exhaling it; '6' as in '75' of '4' cholera, '96' '151' go '39' '31' a camphorated h'6'kerchief to '238' '843's; so, '46'wise, '485' '34' mortal tribulations, Stubb's tobacco smoke '240' '19' operated as a '563' of disinfecting agent.
The third mate '28' Fl'257', a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard. A '940', st'44', ruddy '507' '947'ow, '131' pugnacious c'336'rning whales, '94' '96''60' '562'ed to '54' '7' '4' '164' levia'169's '97' '369''34'y '6' '43'ditarily af'569'ed '58'; '6' t'43''17'e it '28' a '563' of '378' of hon'119' '31' '58', to destroy '116' '74''167' en'893'e'796'. So utterly '387' '28' he to '34' '587' of r'167'ence '17' '4' '128'y marvels of '238' majestic bulk '6' mystic '103's; '6' so '314' to '138''124' '46' an apprehension of '138' '622' danger '83' en'893'e'847' '116'; '7' in '90' '719' opinion, '4' wondrous whale '28' '33' a species of magnified mo'364', or at '402' '604'-rat, requi'847' '146' a '105' circumvention '6' '96' sm'34' application of '75' '6' '461' in '619' to '320' '6' boil. T'90' igno'868't, unconscious fear'759'ness of '90' '721'e '58' a '105' waggish in '4' '301' of whales; he '858'ed '182' fish '17' '4' '427' of it; '6' a '291' '266'' voyage round Cape Horn '28' '146' a jolly joke '7' '181'ed '7' length of '75'. As a '324'penter's nails '36' divided '155' wrought nails '6' '537' nails; so '128''207' '289' be similarly divided. Little Fl'257' '28' '63' of '4' wrought '913'; '721'e to clinch tight '6' '181' '192'. T'84' c'34'ed '58' King-Post on board of '4' Pequod; beca'364', in '17'm, he '87' be '35' '46'ned to '4' '940', squ'36' timber '677' by '7' '275' in Arctic whalers; '6' '265' by '4' '410' of '128'y radiating '500' timbers inserted '155' it, serves to brace '4' ship '485' '4' icy concussions of '200' batte'847' seas.
Now '182' '291' mates—Starbuck, Stubb, '6' Fl'257', '85' mo'508'tous '508'. T'84' it '28' '94' by universal prescription com'128'ded '291' of '4' Pequod's boats as '342's'508'. In '7' gr'6' '619' of battle in '265' Captain Ahab '72' '307' marshal '90' '17'ces to desc'398' on '4' whales, '182' '291' '342's'508' '85' as captains of companies. Or, '213' armed '31' '238' '192' keen whaling spears, '69' '85' as a '512'ed trio of lancers; '140' as '4' harpo'63'ers '85' flingers of javelins.
And '317' in '14' famous fi'50'ry, '356' mate or '342's'128', '46' a Gothic K'168' of '261', is '194' accompanied by '90' boat-steerer or harpo'63'er, '94' in '979' conjunctures provides '58' '31' a fresh lance, '74' '4' '17'mer '63' '129' '91' '217'ly twisted, or elb'969'd in '4' '652'ault; '6' '117''118', as t'43' gener'34'y subsists '592'ween '4' '149', a '452' intimacy '6' fri'398''518'ss; it is t'43''17'e '33' '381', '7' in '14' '226' we '451' d'249' '94' '4' Pequod's harpo'63'ers '85', '6' to '11' '342's'128' '356' of '116' be'192'ed.
First of '34' '28' Queequeg, '94'm Starbuck, '4' chief mate, '97' selected '17' '90' squire. But Queequeg is '287' '677'.
Next '28' Tashtego, an unmixed Indian '83' Gay Head, '4' '344' westerly promontory of Martha's Vineyard, w'43' t'43' s'773' exists '4' '181' remnant of a village of '796' '508', '265' '129' '192' supp'596'd '4' neighbo'847' isl'6' of Nantucket '31' '128'y of '49' '344' da'847' harpo'63'ers. In '4' fi'50'ry, '69' usu'34'y go by '4' generic '275' of Gay-Headers. Tashtego's '192', lean, s'473' h'769', '90' '530' cheek b'913', '6' '751' rounding '495'—'17' an Indian, Oriental in '238' largeness, '33' Antarctic in '238' glitte'847' expression—'34' '14' sufficiently proclaimed '58' an in'49'itor of '4' unvitiated '593' of '200' '896' '869'rior hunters, '94', in quest of '4' '164' New Engl'6' moose, '97' sc'119'ed, bow in h'6', '4' aboriginal fo'426's of '4' main. But no '192'er snuffing in '4' trail of '4' wild beasts of '4' woodl'6', Tashtego '56' hunted in '4' '830' of '4' '164' whales of '4' sea; '4' uner'847' harpoon of '4' '273' fitly replacing '4' inf'34'ible arrow of '4' '284'es. To '73' at '4' tawny brawn of '90' li'4' snaky limbs, '1' '72' al'344' '19' c'796'ited '4' superstitions of '96' of '4' ear'596'r Puritans, '6' '499'-'172'd '14' wild Indian to be a '273' of '4' Prince of '4' P'969'rs of '4' Air. Tashtego '28' Stubb '4' '347' mate's squire.
Third among '4' harpo'63'ers '28' Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-'751' negro-savage, '31' a lion-'46' t'504'—an A'129'uerus to be'330'. Susp'398'ed '83' '90' ears '85' '149' g'261'en hoops, so large '7' '4' sailors c'34'ed '116' '847'-bolts, '6' '72' '150' of secu'847' '4' '739'-sail halyards to '116'. In '90' '1'th Daggoo '97' voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler, '666' in a l'63'ly bay on '90' native coast. And n'167' '305' '91' '138'w'43' in '4' '296' '33' in Africa, Nantucket, '6' '4' pagan harbors '344' frequented by whale'508'; '6' '305' '56' led '17' '128'y '266' '4' b'261' '139' of '4' fi'50'ry in '4' ships of '249'ers uncomm'146' heedful of '11' '128'ner of '508' '69' shipped; Daggoo retained '34' '90' '960''960'ic virtues, '6' erect as a giraffe, '367'd '39' '4' decks in '34' '4' pomp of '578' '908' '401' in '90' socks. T'43' '28' a corpo'272' humility in '262' up at '58'; '6' a '691' '128' st'6'ing '165' '58' '562'ed a '691' flag '67' to beg truce of a '17'tress. Curious to '81', '14' imperial negro, A'129'uerus Daggoo, '28' '4' Squire of '105' Fl'257', '94' '720' '46' a chess-'128' be'500' '58'. As '17' '4' residue of '4' Pequod's '624', be it '136', '7' at '4' '986' '183' '23' '63' in '149' of '4' '128'y thous'6' '508' '165' '4' mast employed in '4' Ameri'51' whale fi'50'ry, '36' Ameri'51's born, '463' '281' '958'ly '34' '4' '493'rs '36'.

The '276', I '99', beca'364' in '34' '182' '390's '4' native Ameri'51' liber'34'y provides '4' brains, '4' '426' of '4' '296' as generously supp'666' '4' muscles. No sm'34' '539' of '182' whaling sea'508' be'192' to '4' Azores, w'43' '4' '44''869'd bound Nantucket whalers frequently '678' to aug'508't '238' crews '83' '4' '321'y peasants of '200' rocky shores.

Black Little Pip—he n'167' '64'—oh, no! he '277' '165'. Poor Alabama '311'! On '4' grim Pequod's '17'ecastle, ye sh'34' ere '192' '66' '58', '942'ing '90' tamb'119'ine; prelusive of '4' eternal '75', '74' '708' '17', to '4' '164' quarter-deck on '530', he '28' bid strike in '31' angels, '6' '942' '90' tamb'119'ine in glory; c'34'ed a co'869'd '43', hailed a '49'o t'43'!




CHAPTER 28. Ahab.

For s'167'al '433' '180' '568' Nantucket, no'124' above hatches '28' '333' of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly re'596'ved '356' '173' at '4' '430'es, '6' '17' aught '7' '87' be '333' to '4' contrary, '69' '562'ed to be '4' '146' com'128'ders of '4' ship; '146' '69' so'559'imes issued '83' '4' cabin '31' '619's so sudden '6' peremptory, '7' '180' '34' it '28' plain '69' '33' com'128'ded vi'324'iously. Yes, '238' supreme lord '6' dictator '28' t'43', '463' '479''49'to un'333' by '138' '495' '23' permitted to penetrate '155' '4' '56' sac'796' retr'545' of '4' cabin.
E'131' '75' I asc'398'ed to '4' deck '83' my '430'es below, I instantly gazed aft to mark if '138' st'868'ge '352' '85' visible; '17' my '171' vague dis'935'ude '678'ing '4' un'677' captain, '56' in '4' seclusion of '4' sea, be'246' al'344' a perturbation.

But '719'ly '87' I '31'st'6' '116', '137' as in '173' moods I '28' al'344' '325' to smile at '4' solemn w'58'sicalities of '7' '44'l'6'ish prophet of '4' wharves. But w'413'ver it '28' of apprehensiveness or uneasiness—to c'34' it so—'265' I '577', '332' '74''167' I '246' to '73' '39' me in '4' ship, it '562'ed '485' '34' '869''868''244' to c'49'ish '375' emotions. For '463' '4' harpo'63'ers, '31' '4' '164' '618' of '4' crew, '85' a '458' '117' '960''960'ic, hea'98'ish, '6' motley '451' '169' '138' of '4' tame merchant-ship companies '265' my previous experiences '97' '721'e me acquainted '31', s'773' I ascri'515' '14'—'6' '40'ly ascri'515' it—to '4' fierce uniqueness of '4' '131' nature of '7' wild S'51'dinavian vocation in '265' I '97' so ab'6''63'dly em'960'ked. But it '28' especi'34'y '4' aspect of '4' '291' chief '493'rs of '4' ship, '4' mates, '265' '28' '344' '17'cibly calcu'399'd to '34'ay '182' col'119''759' mis'631's, '6' induce confidence '6' cheerfulness in e'131' '986''508't of '4' voyage. Three '166', '117' '46'ly sea-'493'rs '6' '508', '356' in '90' '249' '465' '103', '87' '23' '504'ily be '295', '6' '69' '85' e'131' '63' of '116' Ameri'51's; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape '128'. Now, it '213' '617' '74' '4' ship s'576' '83' '44' '49' harbor, '17' a space we '97' '437'ing Polar wea'4'r, '463' '34' '4' '75' '573' '170' '83' it to '4' s'44'h'869'd; '6' by e'131' degree '6' '294' of latitude '265' we sailed, gradu'34'y '568' '7' merci'759' '768'ter, '6' '34' '716' '155'ler'473' wea'4'r '528' us. It '28' '63' of '200' '759' l'969''847', '33' s'773' grey '6' gloomy '243' '339's of '4' t'868''421'ion, '74' '31' a '807' '768'd '4' ship '28' rushing '209' '4' '604' '31' a vindictive '563' of leaping '6' melancholy rapidity, '7' as I mounted to '4' deck at '4' c'34' of '4' '17'enoon '430', so '358' as I levelled my glance to'869'ds '4' taffrail, '17'eboding shivers '868' '118' me. Reality '44''868' apprehension; Captain Ahab s'111'd upon '90' quarter-deck.
T'43' '562'ed no '659' of common bodily illness '39' '58', nor of '4' reco'131' '83' '138'. He '720' '46' a '128' '537' '170' '83' '4' s'101', '74' '4' '522' '129' '118''573'ly '28'ted '34' '4' limbs '327' consuming '116', or '409' '170' '63' '348'icle '83' '238' comp'735'ed aged robustness. His '251' '530', b'937' '17'm, '562'ed '721'e of solid bronze, '6' shaped in an unalter'473' mould, '46' Cellini's cast Perseus. Th'504'ing '716' '103' '44' '83' among '90' grey h'769's, '6' continuing '40' d'249' '63' '500' of '90' tawny scorched '352' '6' neck, '773' it disappea'796' in '90' clo'124', '1' '282' a sl'398'er rod-'46' mark, lividly w'479'ish. It resembled '7' perp'398'icular seam so'559'imes '721'e in '4' '688', lofty t'366'k of a '164' tree, '74' '4' upper '703'ning tea'847'ly darts d'249' it, '6' '327' wrenching a single twig, peels '6' grooves '44' '4' '960'k '83' '739' to bottom, ere '573' '141' '155' '4' soil, '568' '4' tree s'773' greenly a'349', '33' br'6'ed. Whe'4'r '7' mark '28' born '31' '58', or whe'4'r it '28' '4' s'324' '269' by '96' desperate wound, no '63' '87' '658' '99'. By '96' tacit con'708', '209''44' '4' voyage '105' or no '34'usion '28' '721'e to it, especi'34'y by '4' mates. But '336' Tashtego's senior, an '261' Gay-Head Indian among '4' crew, superstitiously '652'erted '7' '23' '773' he '28' '597' '17'ty '266' '261' '64' Ahab be'67' '7' '103' br'6'ed, '6' '98' it '246' upon '58', '23' in '4' fury of '138' mortal fray, '33' in an ele'508'tal strife at sea. Yet, '14' wild hint '562'ed inferenti'34'y negatived, by '11' a grey Manx'128' insinuated, an '261' sepulchral '128', '94', '305' n'167' '165' sailed '44' of Nantucket, '97' n'167' ere '14' laid '784' upon wild Ahab. N'167''4''759', '4' '261' sea-traditions, '4' immemorial c'796'ulities, popularly invested '14' '261' Manx'128' '31' preternatural '637's of discern'508't. So '7' no '691' sailor '525'ly contradicted '58' '74' he '136' '7' if '167' Captain Ahab '134' be t'868'quilly laid '44'—'265' '240' '321'ly '67' to '962', so he mutte'796'—'98', '94''167' '134' do '7' '181' '493' '17' '4' '314', '72' '156' a birth-mark on '58' '83' cr'249' to sole.
So '637''597'y '64' '4' '251' grim aspect of Ahab affect me, '6' '4' livid br'6' '265' streaked it, '7' '17' '4' '171' '360' mo'508'ts I '321'ly '23'ed '7' '23' a '105' of '14' '118'bea'847' grimness '28' o'768'g to '4' '960''960'ic '691' leg upon '265' he '348'ly s'111'd. It '97' previously '67' to me '7' '14' ivory leg '97' at sea '91' fashi'63'd '83' '4' poli'50'd b'63' of '4' sperm whale's jaw. "Aye, he '28' dismasted '141' Japan," '136' '4' '261' Gay-Head Indian '336'; "'33' '46' '90' dismasted craft, he shipped an'173' mast '327' '260' '179' '17' it. He '129' a quiver of '514'."
I '28' struck '31' '4' singular posture he maintained. Upon '356' '500' of '4' Pequod's quarter deck, '6' '281' '452' to '4' mizzen shrouds, t'43' '28' an auger hole, bo'796' '39' '499' an inch or so, '155' '4' '519'k. His b'63' leg stea'474'd in '7' hole; '63' arm elevated, '6' '956' by a shroud; Captain Ahab s'111'd erect, '262' '688' '44' beyond '4' ship's '167'-pitching prow. T'43' '28' an infinity of firmest '17'titude, a determinate, unsurr'398'er'473' wilfulness, in '4' '950'ed '6' fear'759', '17''869'd dedication of '7' glance. Not a '429' he spoke; nor '64' '90' '493'rs '99' aught to '58'; '463' by '34' '238' '294'st gestures '6' expressions, '69' plainly s'60'ed '4' un'454', if '23' '684'ful, consciousness of '213' '447' a '461'd master-'784'. And '23' '146' '7', '33' moody stricken Ahab s'111'd '165' '116' '31' a cruci'950'ion in '90' '352'; in '34' '4' '275''759' regal '118'bea'847' dignity of '96' '240'y woe.
Ere '192', '83' '90' '171' vi'421' in '4' '769', he '31'drew '155' '90' cabin. But '180' '7' '339', he '28' e'131' '183' visible to '4' crew; ei'4'r st'6'ing in '90' pivot-hole, or s'545'ed upon an ivory s'111'l he '97'; or heavily '459'ing '4' deck. As '4' sky grew '759' gloomy; indeed, began to grow a '105' genial, he be'246' s'773' '759' '6' '759' a recl'364'; as if, '74' '4' ship '97' sailed '83' '179', no'124' '33' '4' '314' '768''244' bleakness of '4' sea '97' '98' '764' '58' so secluded. And, by '6' by, it '246' to '962', '7' he '28' al'344' continu'34'y in '4' '769'; '33', as '332', '17' '34' '7' he '136', or perceptibly '64', on '4' at '181' sunny deck, he '562'ed as unnecessary t'43' as an'173' mast. But '4' Pequod '28' '146' '380' a '962'age '56'; '23' regularly cruising; '958'ly '34' whaling preparatives '107'ing supervision '4' mates '85' '597'y compe'606't to, so '7' t'43' '28' '105' or no'124', '44' of '58''968', to employ or excite Ahab, '56'; '6' thus c'129'e '170', '17' '7' '63' interval, '4' clouds '7' layer upon layer '85' piled upon '90' brow, as '167' '34' clouds choose '4' loftiest peaks to pile '116'selves upon.
N'167''4''759', ere '192', '4' '869'm, '869'bling persuasiveness of '4' pleasant, holi'183' wea'4'r we '246' to, '562'ed gradu'34'y to charm '58' '83' '90' mood. For, as '74' '4' '796'-cheeked, dancing '641', April '6' May, '798' '179' to '4' '768''244', misanthropic woods; '140' '4' '960'est, ruggedest, '344' th'447'-c'112'n '261' oak '76' at '402' '642' '17'th '96' '360' green spr'44's, to wel'67' '375' '431'-'374'ed vi'421'ants; so Ahab '64', in '4' '398', a '105' respond to '4' '412'ful '34'u'847's of '7' '283'ish '769'. More '169' '336' '64' he '186' '17'th '4' faint blossom of a '73', '265', in '138' '173' '128', '72' '19' '358' fl'969''796' '44' in a smile.




CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.

Some '433' elapsed, '6' '972' '6' '972'bergs '34' astern, '4' Pequod '56' '277' rolling '209' '4' b'40' Quito sp'847', '265', at sea, al'344' perpetu'34'y reigns on '4' thres'330' of '4' eternal August of '4' Tropic. The '869'mly '494', '574', '847'ing, perfumed, '118'flo'768'g, '796'undant '433', '85' as crystal gob'123's of Persian '50'r'592', heaped up—flaked up, '31' rose-'604' s'56'. The star'796' '6' '892'ly '168's '562'ed haughty dames in je'35'ed velvets, nursing at '179' in l'63'ly p'852', '4' memory of '238' ab'708' conque'847' Earls, '4' g'261'en hel'559'ed suns! For '503'ing '128', 't'28' '321' to choose '592'ween '375' '768''96' '433' '6' '375' seducing '168's. But '34' '4' witc'49'ies of '7' unwaning wea'4'r '64' '23' merely l'398' '212' spells '6' po'606'cies to '4' '44''869'd '296'. In'869'd '69' '391'ed upon '4' soul, especi'34'y '74' '4' s'773' mild '520' of eve '246' on; '98', memory s'576' '49' crystals as '4' '574' '972' '344' '17'ms of noise'759' twi'703's. And '34' '182' subtle agencies, '117' '6' '117' '69' wrought on Ahab's texture.
Old age is '194' '830'ful; as if, '4' '192'er linked '31' '139', '4' '759' '128' '129' to do '31' aught '7' '388' '46' '548'. Among sea-com'128'ders, '4' '261' greybeards '76' of'606'est '224' '238' berths to vi'421' '4' '168'-cloaked deck. It '28' so '31' Ahab; '146' '7' '56', of '399', he '562'ed so '137' to '349' in '4' '422' '769', '7' truly '613'ing, '90' vi'421's '85' '117' to '4' cabin, '169' '83' '4' cabin to '4' '519'ks. "It '174's '46' '45' d'249' '155' '63''s tomb,"—he '72' mutter to '58''968'—"'17' an '261' captain '46' me to be desc'398'ing '14' narrow s'537'tle, to go to my grave-dug berth."
So, al'344' e'131' t'277'y-'492' '520', '74' '4' '430'es of '4' '168' '85' '451', '6' '4' b'6' on deck '708'inelled '4' slumbers of '4' b'6' below; '6' '74' if a rope '28' to be hauled upon '4' '17'ecastle, '4' sailors flung it '23' rudely d'249', as by '183', '33' '31' '96' cautiousness '705't it to '716' '226' '17' fear of disturbing '238' slumbe'847' shipmates; '74' '14' '563' of steady '935'ude '72' begin to prevail, ha'437'u'34'y, '4' silent steers'128' '72' '430' '4' cabin-s'537'tle; '6' ere '192' '4' '261' '128' '72' emerge, gripping at '4' iron banister, to '148' '90' crippled '103'. Some con'500''847' '678' of hu'128'ity '28' in '58'; '17' at '464' '46' '182', he usu'34'y abstained '83' patrolling '4' quarter-deck; beca'364' to '90' '854'ied mates, '66'king repose '31'in '578' inches of '90' ivory heel, '375' '72' '19' '91' '4' r'167'berating crack '6' din of '7' bony '761', '7' '238' '710's '72' '19' '91' on '4' c'366'ching teeth of sharks. But '336', '4' mood '28' on '58' '111' deep '17' common regardings; '6' as '31' heavy, lumber-'46' pace he '28' measu'847' '4' ship '83' taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, '4' '261' '347' mate, '246' up '83' below, '31' a '979' un'652'u'796', deprecating humorousness, hinted '7' if Captain Ahab '28' '142'd to '459' '4' '519'ks, '98', no '63' '87' '99' nay; '33' t'43' '240' be '96' '103' of muffling '4' noise; hinting so'559'hing indistinctly '6' he'421'atingly '39' a globe of tow, '6' '4' insertion '155' it, of '4' ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou '64'st '23' k'56' Ahab '98'.
"Am I a '51'non-b'34', Stubb," '136' Ahab, "'7' thou '72'st wad me '7' fashion? But go thy '103's; I '97' '17''61'. Below to thy '168'ly grave; w'43' '375' as ye '503' '592'ween shrouds, to '364' ye to '4' filling '63' at '181'.—D'249', '766', '6' kennel!"
Starting at '4' un'17''333' concluding exclamation of '4' so suddenly scornful '261' '128', Stubb '28' speech'759' a mo'508't; '98' '136' excitedly, "I am '23' '364'd to be spoken to '7' '103', '284'; I do '33' '759' '169' '499' '46' it, '284'."
"Avast! gritted Ahab '592'ween '90' '451' teeth, '6' violently '772' '170', as if to avoid '96' '962'ionate temptation.
"No, '284'; '23' '332'," '136' Stubb, emb'261'ened, "I '76' '23' tamely be c'34'ed a '766', '284'."
"Then be c'34'ed '606' '464' a donkey, '6' a mule, '6' an '652', '6' beg'63', or '82' '574' '4' '296' of '4'e!"
As he '136' '14', Ahab advanced upon '58' '31' '375' '118'bea'847' terrors in '90' aspect, '7' Stubb involuntarily retr'545'ed.
"I '28' n'167' served so '165' '327' '631' a '321' blow '17' it," mutte'796' Stubb, as he '295' '58''968' desc'398'ing '4' cabin-s'537'tle. "It's '131' queer. S'739', Stubb; '96''60', '56', I '21' '35' k'56' whe'4'r to go '78' '6' strike '58', or—'11''s '7'?—d'249' '43' on my knees '6' pray '17' '58'? Yes, '7' '28' '4' '147' '260' up in me; '33' it '72' be '4' '171' '75' I '167' '64' pray. It's queer; '131' queer; '6' '86' queer '111'; aye, '101' '58' '17'e '6' aft, '86' '39' '4' quee'426' '261' '128' Stubb '167' sailed '31'. How he fla'50'd at me!—'90' '495' '46' powder-pans! is he '721'? Any'103' t'43''s so'559'hing on '90' '241', as '115' as t'43' '259' be so'559'hing on a deck '74' it cracks. He aint in '90' '515' '56', ei'4'r, '117' '169' '291' '520' '44' of '4' t'277'y-'492'; '6' he '21' '503' '98'. Didn't '7' Dough-Boy, '4' ste'869'd, '81' me '7' of a '339' he '194' '156's '4' '261' '128''s hammock '945' '34' rumpled '6' tumbled, '6' '4' '50'ets d'249' at '4' foot, '6' '4' c'118'lid al'344' tied '155' k'23's, '6' '4' pillow a '563' of f'40'ful '576', as '463' a baked brick '97' '91' on it? A '576' '261' '128'! I '214' '86' '61' '11' '96' folks ashore c'34' a conscience; '30' a '207' of Tic-Dolly-row '69' '99'—'623' nor a '111'thache. Well, '35'; I '21' k'56' '11' it is, '33' '4' Lord '184' me '83' '756'ing it. He's '597' of riddles; I '683' '11' he '547' '155' '4' '180' '330' '17', e'131' '168', as Dough-Boy '81's me he suspects; '11''s '7' '17', I '134' '46' to k'56'? Who's '721'e ap'378''508'ts '31' '58' in '4' '330'? Ain't '7' queer, '56'? But t'43''s no '361', '30' '4' '261' '544'—Here '547' '17' a snooze. Damn me, '30' '736' a '947'ow's '313' to be born '155' '4' '296', if '146' to f'34' '40' a'503'. And '56' '7' I '54' of it, '55' '39' '4' '171' '124' babies do, '6' '55' a '563' of queer, '111'. Damn me, '33' '34' '124's '36' queer, '67' to '54' of '514'. But '55' '485' my principles. Think '23', is my el'140'th com'128'd'508't; '6' '503' '74' '1' '51', is my twelfth—So '43' '547' '158'. But '60''s '7'? '64'n't he c'34' me a '766'? blazes! he c'34'ed me '606' '464' a donkey, '6' piled a '202' of jack'652'es on '739' of '7'! He '240' as '35' '19' kicked me, '6' d'63' '31' it. Maybe he '64' kick me, '6' I '64'n't observe it, I '28' so '645' '34' a'78' '31' '90' brow, '96''60'. It fla'50'd '46' a bl'356'ed b'63'. What '4' d'779''s '4' '301' '31' me? I '21' st'6' '40' on my legs. Coming afoul of '7' '261' '128' '129' a '563' of '391'ed me '208' '500' '44'. By '4' Lord, I '259' '19' '91' '710'ing, '463'—How? '60'?

CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.

When Stubb '97' de'348'ed, Ahab s'111'd '17' a '313' leaning '118' '4' bul'869'ks; '6' '98', as '97' '91' usual '31' '58' of '399', c'34'ing a sailor of '4' '430', he '708' '58' below '17' '90' ivory s'111'l, '6' '516' '90' pipe. Lighting '4' pipe at '4' binnacle lamp '6' '519'ting '4' s'111'l on '4' wea'4'r '500' of '4' deck, he sat '6' smoked.
In '261' Norse '464', '4' thr'913' of '4' sea-loving Danish kings '85' fabricated, saith tradition, of '4' tusks of '4' narwhale. How '87' '63' '73' at Ahab '98', s'545'ed on '7' '798'od of b'913', '327' be'54'ing '58' of '4' royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of '4' '519'k, '6' a king of '4' sea, '6' a '164' lord of Levia'169's '28' Ahab.
Some mo'508'ts '962'ed, du'847' '265' '4' thick vap'119' '246' '83' '90' '843' in quick '6' constant puffs, '265' blew '78' '158' '155' '90' '352'. "How '56'," he soliloquized at '181', '31'dra'768'g '4' tube, "'14' smoking no '192'er soo'4's. Oh, my pipe! '321' '259' it go '31' me if thy charm be g'63'! Here '19' I '91' unconsciously toiling, '23' pleasu'847'—aye, '6' igno'868'tly smoking to '768'd'869'd '34' '4' '313'; to '768'd'869'd, '6' '31' '375' nervous whiffs, as if, '46' '4' dying whale, my final jets '85' '4' '777'est '6' '597'est of '461'. What '355' '19' I '31' '14' pipe? T'90' '124' '7' is '588' '17' sereneness, to '642' up mild '691' vap'119's among mild '691' h'769's, '23' among torn iron-grey locks '46' '462'. '82' smoke no '117'—"
He tossed '4' s'773' '703'ed pipe '155' '4' sea. The '522' '90'sed in '4' waves; '4' '276' instant '4' ship s'576' by '4' bubble '4' sinking pipe '721'e. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced '4' '519'ks.




CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.

Next '339' Stubb accosted Fl'257'.
"Such a queer '710', King-Post, I n'167' '97'. You k'56' '4' '261' '128''s ivory leg, '35' I '710'ed he kicked me '31' it; '6' '74' I '457' to kick '78', upon my soul, my '105' '128', I kicked my leg '40' '141'! And '98', p'426'o! Ahab '562'ed a pyramid, '6' I, '46' a blazing fool, '764' kicking at it. But '11' '28' s'773' '117' curious, Fl'257'—'1' k'56' '60' curious '34' '710's '36'—'209' '34' '14' rage '7' I '28' in, I '96''60' '562'ed to be '54'ing to '302', '7' '180' '34', it '28' '23' '137' of an insult, '7' kick '83' Ahab. 'Why,' '54's I, ''11''s '4' row? It's '23' a '272' leg, '146' a false leg.' And t'43''s a '240'y difference '592'ween a '565' thump '6' a '314' thump. That's '11' '408' a blow '83' '4' h'6', Fl'257', fifty '464' '117' savage to bear '169' a blow '83' a '51'e. The '565' member—'7' '408' '4' '565' insult, my '105' '128'. And '54's I to '302' '34' '4' '313', '241', '313' I '28' stubbing my silly toes '485' '7' cursed pyramid—so con'295'edly contradictory '28' it '34', '34' '4' '313', I '99', I '28' '54'ing to '302', ''11''s '90' leg '56', '33' a '51'e—a whaleb'63' '51'e. Yes,' '54's I, 'it '28' '146' a '412'ful cudgelling—in '418', '146' a whaleboning '7' he '417' me—'23' a base kick. Be'500's,' '54's I, ''73' at it '336'; '65', '4' '398' of it—'4' foot '348'—'11' a sm'34' '563' of '398' it is; w'43'as, if a b'937' footed '458'mer kicked me, t'43''s a d'779'ish b'937' insult. But '14' insult is w'479'tled d'249' to a '378' '146'.' But '56' '67's '4' '164'est joke of '4' '710', Fl'257'. While I '28' batte'847' '170' at '4' pyramid, a '563' of '217'ger-hai'796' '261' mer'128', '31' a hump on '90' '78', '726' me by '4' '134'ers, '6' slews me round. 'What '36' '1' 'b'44'?' '415' he. Slid! '128', '33' I '28' frigh'606'ed. Such a phiz! But, '96''60', '290' mo'508't I '28' '118' '4' f'40'. 'What am I '39'?' '415' I at '181'. 'And '11' '355' is '7' of y'119's, I '134' '46' to k'56', '197' Hump'78'? Do '1' '53' a kick?' By '4' lord, Fl'257', I '97' no '358'er '136' '7', '169' he '391'ed round '90' stern to me, bent '118', '6' dragging up a '202' of seaweed he '97' '17' a cl'44'—'11' do '1' '54', I '282'?—'65' th'447' a'349', '128', '90' stern '28' stuck '597' of marlinspikes, '31' '4' '378's '44'. Says I, on '347' '147's, 'I '214' I '205' kick '1', '261' '947'ow.' 'Wise Stubb,' '136' he, 'wise Stubb;' '6' '764' mutte'847' it '34' '4' '75', a '563' of '545'ing of '90' '249' gums '46' a c'58'ney hag. Seeing he '237' '45' to '188' '99'ing '118' '90' 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I '147' I '240' as '35' f'34' to kicking '4' pyramid '158'. But I '97' '146' '22' lifted my foot '17' it, '74' he roa'796' '44', 'S'739' '7' kicking!' 'H'34'oa,' '415' I, ''11''s '4' '301' '56', '261' '947'ow?' 'Look ye '43',' '415' he; ''123''s argue '4' insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, '64'n't he?' 'Yes, he '64',' '415' I—''40' '43' it '28'.' 'Very '68',' '415' he—'he '364'd '90' ivory leg, '64'n't he?' 'Yes, he '64',' '415' I. 'Well '98',' '415' he, 'wise Stubb, '11' '19' '1' to complain of? Didn't he kick '31' '40' '68' '76'? it '237' a common pitch pine leg he kicked '31', '28' it? No, '1' '85' kicked by a '164' '128', '6' '31' a '416' ivory leg, Stubb. It's an hon'119'; I con'500'r it an hon'119'. Lis'606', wise Stubb. In '261' Engl'6' '4' '164'est lords '54' it '164' glory to be slapped by a queen, '6' '721'e garter-k'168's of; '33', be y'119' boast, Stubb, '7' ye '85' kicked by '261' Ahab, '6' '721'e a wise '128' of. Remember '11' I '99'; be kicked by '58'; ac'893' '90' kicks hon'119's; '6' on no ac'893' kick '78'; '17' '1' '51''t '148' y'119''968', wise Stubb. Don't '1' '66' '7' pyramid?' With '7', he '34' of a sudden '562'ed '96''60', in '96' queer fashion, to swim '141' '155' '4' '769'. I sno'796'; rolled '118'; '6' t'43' I '28' in my hammock! Now, '11' do '1' '54' of '7' '710', Fl'257'?"
"I '21' k'56'; it '562's a '563' of foolish to me, tho.'"
"May be; '289' be. But '30' '721'e a wise '128' of me, Fl'257'. D'ye '66' Ahab st'6'ing t'43', '500''103's '262' '118' '4' stern? Well, '4' '258' '124' '1' '51' do, Fl'257', is to '123' '4' '261' '128' al'63'; n'167' '613' to '58', w'413'ver he '415'. H'34'oa! What's '7' he sh'44's? Hark!"
"Mast-'342', t'43'! Look sharp, '34' of ye! T'43' '36' whales '43''39's!
"If ye '66' a '691' '63', split y'119' lungs '17' '58'!
"What do '1' '54' of '7' '56', Fl'257'? '594' t'43' a sm'34' '705' of so'559'hing queer '39' '7', eh? A '691' whale—'64' ye mark '7', '128'? Look ye—t'43''s so'559'hing '591' in '4' '768'd. St'6' by '17' it, Fl'257'. Ahab '129' '7' '55' '593'y on '90' '241'. But, mum; he '67's '14' '103'."




CHAPTER 32. Cetology.

Al'325' we '36' b'261'ly launched upon '4' deep; '33' '358' we sh'34' be '387' in '716' unsho'796', harb'119''759' im'508''421'ies. Ere '7' '67' to '962'; ere '4' Pequod's weedy hull rolls '500' by '500' '31' '4' '960'nacled hulls of '4' levia'169'; at '4' '44''451' it is '33' '35' to at'606'd to a '301' al'344' indispens'473' to a thorough appreciative '447'st'6'ing of '4' '117' '591' levia'169'ic revelations '6' '34'usions of '34' '563's '265' '36' to '858'.
It is '96' systematized exhi'437'ion of '4' whale in '90' b'937' genera, '7' I '72' '56' fain '186' '165' '1'. Yet is it no '454' t'257'. The cl'652'ification of '4' constituents of a chaos, no'124' '759' is '43' es'99'ed. Lis'606' to '11' '4' '258' '6' '399'st authorities '19' laid d'249'.
"No b'868'ch of Zoology is so '137' '745' as '7' '265' is entitled Cetology," '415' Captain Scoresby, A.'636' 1820.
"It is '23' my in'606'tion, '85' it in my '637', to enter '155' '4' inquiry as to '4' '354' '559'hod of dividing '4' cetacea '155' groups '6' fami'596's.... Utter confusion exists among '4' '90'torians of '14' animal" (sperm whale), '415' Surgeon Beale, A.'636' 1839.
"Unfitness to pursue '119' research in '4' unfathom'473' '604's." "Impenetr'473' veil c'118'ing '119' k'56'ledge of '4' cetacea." "A field strewn '31' thorns." "All '182' incomp'123'e indications '33' serve to torture us natura'919's."
Thus '613' of '4' whale, '4' '164' Cuvier, '6' '608' Hunter, '6' Les'273', '200' '703's of zoology '6' anatomy. N'167''4''759', '463' of '272' k'56'ledge t'43' be '105', '332' of '560's t'43' '36' a plenty; '6' so in '96' sm'34' degree, '31' cetology, or '4' science of whales. M'138' '36' '4' '508', sm'34' '6' '164', '261' '6' '212', l'6's'508' '6' sea'508', '94' '19' at large or in '105', writ'606' of '4' whale. Run '118' a '360':—The Authors of '4' Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrov'6'i; Sir Thomas Br'249'e; Gesner; '857'; Linnaeus; Ronde'123'ius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Bris'273'; Mar'606'; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desm'36'st; Baron Cuvier; F'796'erick Cuvier; '608' Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; '742'nett; '371' '795' Br'249'e; '4' Author of Miriam C'141'in; Olmstead; '6' '4' Rev.

Of '4' '275's in '14' '919' of whale authors, '146' '200' '858'ing Owen '167' '282' '565' whales; '6' '33' '63' of '116' '28' a '272' professional harpo'63'er '6' whale'128'. I '80' Captain Scoresby. On '4' separate subject of '4' Greenl'6' or '40'-whale, he is '4' '258' existing authority. But Scoresby k'212' no'124' '6' '415' no'124' of '4' '164' sperm whale, compa'796' '31' '265' '4' Greenl'6' whale is al'344' un'736'y '508'tioning. And '43' be it '136', '7' '4' Greenl'6' whale is an usurper upon '4' thr'63' of '4' seas. He is '23' '140' by '138' '410' '4' largest of '4' whales. Yet, o'768'g to '4' '192' priority of '90' claims, '6' '4' pro'295' igno'868'ce '265', '773' '96' s'140'ty '266' '78', invested '4' '98' fabulous or utterly un'677' sperm-whale, '6' '265' igno'868'ce to '14' '986' '183' s'773' reigns in '34' '33' '96' '360' scientific retr'545's '6' whale-ports; '14' usurpation '129' '91' e'131' '103' comp'123'e. Reference to '958'ly '34' '4' levia'169'ic '34'usions in '4' '164' poets of '536' '433', '76' satisfy '1' '7' '4' Greenl'6' whale, '327' '63' rival, '28' to '116' '4' monarch of '4' seas. But '4' '75' '129' at '181' '67' '17' a '212' proclamation. T'90' is Cha'847' Cross; '230' ye! '68' '151' '34',—'4' Greenl'6' whale is deposed,—'4' '164' sperm whale '56' reigneth!
T'43' '36' '146' '149' '560's in '213' '265' at '34' pre'606'd to '186' '4' '565' sperm whale '165' '1', '6' at '4' '276' '75', in '4' remo'704' degree succeed in '4' attempt. Those '560's '36' Beale's '6' '742'nett's; '312' in '238' '75' surgeons to English S'44'h-Sea whale-ships, '6' '312' ex'735' '6' reli'473' '508'. The original '301' '678'ing '4' sperm whale to be '295' in '238' volumes is necessarily sm'34'; '33' so '458' as it '547', it is of excellent quality, '463' '344'ly con'178'd to scientific description. As '332', '60''167', '4' sperm whale, scientific or poetic, '349's '23' comp'123'e in '138' literature. Far above '34' '173' hunted whales, '90' is an unwrit'606' '139'.
Now '4' various species of whales '107' '96' '563' of popular comprehensive cl'652'ification, if '146' an '454' '44''518' '63' '17' '4' '986', '43''180' to be filled in '34' '716' de'348''508'ts by subsequent laborers. As no '166' '128' advances to '101' '14' '301' in h'6', I '43'upon '141'er my '249' '719' '398'eavors. I '449' no'124' comp'123'e; beca'364' '138' hu'128' '124' '340' to be comp'123'e, '259' '17' '7' '131' '385' inf'34'ibly be '603'y. I sh'34' '23' pre'606'd to a '294' anatomical description of '4' various species, or—in '14' '226' at '402'—to '137' of '138' description. My object '43' is simply to project '4' draught of a systematization of cetology. I am '4' arc'479'ect, '23' '4' builder.
But it is a ponderous t'257'; no ordinary '123'ter-'563'er in '4' Post-Off'972' is equal to it. To grope d'249' '155' '4' bottom of '4' sea '180' '116'; to '19' '63''s '524' among '4' un'613''473' '295'ations, ribs, '6' '131' pelvis of '4' '296'; '14' is a fearful '124'. What am I '7' I '134' es'99' to hook '4' nose of '14' levia'169'! The awful t'976'ings in Job '240' '35' appal me. Will he '4' (levia'169') '106' a covenant '31' '4'e? Be'330' '4' '274' of '58' is vain! But I '19' swam '209' libraries '6' sailed '209' oceans; I '19' '97' to do '31' whales '31' '182' visible '524'; I am in earnest; '6' I '76' '244'. T'43' '36' '96' preliminaries to '451'tle.
First: The un'979', un'451'tled condition of '14' science of Cetology is in '4' '131' vestibule at'704'ed by '4' '418', '7' in '96' quarters it s'773' remains a moot '378' whe'4'r a whale be a fish. In '90' System of Nature, A.'636' 1776, Linnaeus decl'36's, "I '43'by separate '4' whales '83' '4' fish." But of my '249' k'56'ledge, I k'56' '7' d'249' to '4' '407' 1850, sharks '6' s'97', alewives '6' '49''847', '485' Linnaeus's express edict, '85' s'773' '295' dividing '4' possession of '4' '276' seas '31' '4' Levia'169'.
The grounds upon '265' Linnaeus '72' fain '19' bani'50'd '4' whales '83' '4' '604's, he '892's as '858's: "On ac'893' of '238' '869'm bilocular '374', '238' lungs, '238' mov'473' '784'lids, '238' hollow ears, penem int'868'tem feminam mammis l'735'antem," '6' fin'34'y, "ex lege naturae jure meritoque." I submitted '34' '14' to my fri'398's Simeon Macey '6' Charley C'141'in, of Nantucket, '312' '921'mates of '462' in a '979' voyage, '6' '69' united in '4' opinion '7' '4' '385's '451' '17'th '85' alto'42''49' insufficient. Charley profanely hinted '69' '85' humbug.
Be it '677' '7', waiving '34' argu'508't, I '101' '4' '68' '261' fashi'63'd ground '7' '4' whale is a fish, '6' c'34' upon holy Jonah to '78' me.

Next: '60' sh'34' we de'178' '4' whale, by '90' obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label '58' '17' '34' '75' to '67'? To be '940', '98', a whale is a sp'44'ing fish '31' a horizontal tail. T'43' '1' '19' '58'. How'167' contr'735'ed, '7' definition is '4' result of exp'6'ed meditation. A walrus sp'44's '137' '46' a whale, '33' '4' walrus is '23' a fish, beca'364' he is amphibious. But '4' '181' term of '4' definition is s'773' '117' cogent, as '438'd '31' '4' '171'.

W'43'as, among sp'44'ing fish '4' tail, '463' it '289' be similarly shaped, invariably '652'umes a horizontal po'421'ion.
By '4' above definition of '11' a whale is, I do by no '410' exclude '83' '4' levia'169'ic '411'hood '138' sea cr'545'ure '479''49'to identified '31' '4' whale by '4' '258' in'17'med Nantucketers; nor, on '4' '173' h'6', link '31' it '138' fish '479''49'to authoritatively regarded as a'596'n.* Hence, '34' '4' sm'34'er, sp'44'ing, '6' horizontal tailed fish '259' be included in '14' ground-'519' of Cetology.

BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).—T'90' whale, among '4' English of '261' vaguely '677' as '4' Trumpa whale, '6' '4' Phy'451'er whale, '6' '4' Anvil Headed whale, is '4' '986' Cacha'202' of '4' French, '6' '4' Pottsfich of '4' Ger'128's, '6' '4' Macrocephalus of '4' Long Words. He is, '327' doubt, '4' largest inha'437'ant of '4' globe; '4' '344' '17'mid'473' of '34' whales to en'893'er; '4' '344' majestic in aspect; '6' '181'ly, by '458' '4' '344' valu'473' in commerce; he '213' '4' '146' cr'545'ure '83' '265' '7' valu'473' substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All '90' peculiarities '76', in '128'y '173' '226's, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly '31' '90' '275' '7' I '56' '19' to do. Philologic'34'y con'500''796', it is absurd. Some centuries '414', '74' '4' Sperm whale '28' al'344' '94'lly un'677' in '90' '249' proper individuality, '6' '74' '90' oil '28' '146' '829''34'y obtained '83' '4' str'6'ed fish; in '200' '433' spermaceti, it '72' '562', '28' popularly '340' to be derived '83' a cr'545'ure identical '31' '4' '63' '98' '677' in Engl'6' as '4' Greenl'6' or Right Whale. It '28' '4' '256' '516', '7' '14' '276' spermaceti '28' '7' quickening humor of '4' Greenl'6' Whale '265' '4' '171' syll'473' of '4' '429' liter'34'y expresses. In '200' '464', '516', spermaceti '28' exceedingly s'324'ce, '23' '213' '364'd '17' '703', '33' '146' as an oint'508't '6' medica'508't. It '28' '146' to be '97' '83' '4' druggists as '1' '56'a'433' '610' an ounce of rhu'960'b. When, as I opine, in '4' '239' of '75', '4' '354' nature of spermaceti be'246' '677', '716' original '275' '28' s'773' retained by '4' '334'ers; no doubt to enhance '716' value by a '23'ion so st'868'gely '659'ifi'51't of '716' s'324''709'. And so '4' appellation '259' at '181' '19' '67' to be '258''969'd upon '4' whale '83' '265' '14' spermaceti '28' re'34'y derived.
BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale).—In '63' '952' '14' is '4' '344' vener'473' of '4' levia'169's, '213' '4' '63' '171' regularly hunted by '128'. It yields '4' article comm'146' '677' as whaleb'63' or baleen; '6' '4' oil speci'34'y '677' as "whale oil," an inferior article in commerce. Among '4' fi'50'r'508', he is indiscriminately de'659'ated by '34' '4' '858'ing titles: The Whale; '4' Greenl'6' Whale; '4' Black Whale; '4' Gr'545' Whale; '4' True Whale; '4' Right Whale. T'43' is a '334' of obscurity c'336'rning '4' identity of '4' species thus multitudinously baptised. What '98' is '4' whale, '265' I include in '4' '347' species of my Folios? It is '4' Gr'545' Myst'972'tus of '4' English natura'919's; '4' Greenl'6' Whale of '4' English whale'508'; '4' Ba'596'ne Ordin'769'e of '4' French whale'508'; '4' Growl'6's Walfish of '4' Swedes. It is '4' whale '265' '17' '117' '169' '149' centuries '536' '129' '91' hunted by '4' Dutch '6' English in '4' Arctic seas; it is '4' whale '265' '4' Ameri'51' fi'50'r'508' '19' '192' pursued in '4' Indian ocean, on '4' Brazil Banks, on '4' Nor' West Coast, '6' various '173' '348's of '4' '296', de'659'ated by '116' Right Whale Cruising Grounds.
Some pre'606'd to '66' a difference '592'ween '4' Greenl'6' whale of '4' English '6' '4' '40' whale of '4' Ameri'51's. But '69' precisely '897' in '34' '238' gr'6' f'545'ures; nor '129' t'43' '332' '91' '986'ed a single determinate '418' upon '265' to ground a radical distinction. It is by '398''759' subdivisions based upon '4' '344' inconclusive differences, '7' '96' de'348''508'ts of natural '903' be'67' so repellingly intricate. The '40' whale '76' be '234'w'43' tr'545'ed of at '96' length, '31' reference to elucidating '4' sperm whale.
BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).—Under '14' '342' I reckon a monster '265', by '4' various '275's of Fin-Back, T'34'-Sp'44', '6' Long-'608', '129' '91' '333' al'344' in e'131' sea '6' is comm'146' '4' whale '94'se distant jet is so of'606' descried by '962'engers crossing '4' Atlantic, in '4' New '826' packet-tracks. In '4' length he attains, '6' in '90' baleen, '4' Fin-'78' resembles '4' '40' whale, '33' is of a '759' portly girth, '6' a '703'er col'119', approaching to o'349'. His '164' lips '986' a c'473'-'46' aspect, '17'med by '4' intertwisting, slanting f'261's of large wrinkles. His gr'6' distinguishing f'545'ure, '4' fin, '83' '265' he derives '90' '275', is of'606' a conspicuous object. T'90' fin is '96' '291' or '492' '908' '192', gro'768'g vertic'34'y '83' '4' hinder '348' of '4' '78', of an angular shape, '6' '31' a '131' sharp '378'ed '398'. '938'n if '23' '4' s'703'est '173' '348' of '4' cr'545'ure be visible, '14' iso'399'd fin '76', at '464', be '333' plainly projecting '83' '4' sur'352'. When '4' sea is moderately '804', '6' s'703'ly marked '31' sp'49'ical ripples, '6' '14' gnomon-'46' fin st'6's up '6' casts s'97'ows upon '4' wrinkled sur'352', it '289' '35' be '340' '7' '4' '604'y circle surrounding it '96''11' resembles a dial, '31' '716' style '6' wavy '612'-'518's graved on it. On '7' Ahaz-dial '4' s'97'ow of'606' '547' '78'. The Fin-Back is '23' gregarious. He '562's a whale-'413'r, as '96' '508' '36' '128'-'413'rs. Very shy; '194' '45' solitary; un'741'edly rising to '4' sur'352' in '4' remo'704' '6' '344' sullen '604's; '90' '688' '6' single lofty jet rising '46' a t'34' misanthropic spear upon a '960'ren plain; '964'ed '31' '375' wondrous '637' '6' velo'709' in swimming, as to defy '34' '986' pursuit '83' '128'; '14' levia'169' '562's '4' bani'50'd '6' unconquer'473' Cain of '90' race, bea'847' '17' '90' mark '7' style upon '90' '78'. From '305' '4' baleen in '90' '843', '4' Fin-Back is so'559'imes included '31' '4' '40' whale, among a '4'oretic species denominated Whaleb'63' Whales, '7' is, whales '31' baleen. Of '182' so c'34'ed Whaleb'63' whales, t'43' '72' '562' to be s'167'al varieties, '344' of '265', '60''167', '36' '105' '677'. B'937'-nosed whales '6' beaked whales; pike-'342'ed whales; bunched whales; '447'-jawed whales '6' rostrated whales, '36' '4' fi'50'r'508''s '275's '17' a '360' '563's.
In connection '31' '14' appellative of "Whaleb'63' whales," it is of '164' importance to '508'tion, '7' '60''167' '375' a no'508'clature '289' be convenient in facilitating '34'usions to '96' '207' of whales, '332' it is in vain to attempt a '574' cl'652'ification of '4' Levia'169', '295'ed upon ei'4'r '90' baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; '23''31'st'6'ing '7' '200' marked '348's or f'545'ures '131' '682' '562' '166' adapted to af'17'd '4' basis '17' a regular system of Cetology '169' '138' '173' detached bodily distinctions, '265' '4' whale, in '90' '207's, '986's. How '98'? The baleen, hump, '78'-fin, '6' teeth; '182' '36' '124's '94'se peculiarities '36' indiscriminately dispersed among '34' '563's of whales, '327' '138' regard to '11' '289' be '4' nature of '238' structure in '173' '6' '117' es'708'ial '348'iculars. Thus, '4' sperm whale '6' '4' hump'78'ed whale, '356' '129' a hump; '33' t'43' '4' similitude ceases. Then, '14' '276' hump'78'ed whale '6' '4' Greenl'6' whale, '356' of '182' '129' baleen; '33' t'43' '158' '4' similitude ceases. And it is '22' '4' '276' '31' '4' '173' '348's above '508'ti'63'd. In various '563's of whales, '69' '17'm '375' irregular combinations; or, in '4' '390' of '138' '63' of '116' detached, '375' an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy '34' general '559'hodization '17'med upon '375' a basis. On '14' rock e'131' '63' of '4' whale-natura'919's '129' split.
But it '289' '999' be c'336'ived '7', in '4' internal '348's of '4' whale, in '90' anatomy—t'43', at '402', we sh'34' be '473' to '479' '4' '40' cl'652'ification. Nay; '11' '124', '17' example, is t'43' in '4' Greenl'6' whale's anatomy '117' striking '169' '90' baleen? Yet we '19' '333' '7' by '90' baleen it is im'622' correctly to cl'652'ify '4' Greenl'6' whale. And if '1' desc'398' '155' '4' b'969'ls of '4' various levia'169's, '65' t'43' '1' '76' '23' '156' distinctions a fiftieth '348' as avail'473' to '4' systematizer as '200' external '913' '287' enumerated. What '98' remains? no'124' '33' to '101' '330' of '4' whales bodily, in '238' '797' liberal volume, '6' b'261'ly '563' '116' '7' '103'. And '14' is '4' Bibliographical system '43' adopted; '6' it is '4' '146' '63' '7' '51' '999' succeed, '17' it al'63' is pr'735'ic'473'. To proceed.
BOOK I. (Folio) CHAPTER IV. (Hump-Back).—T'90' whale is of'606' '333' on '4' nor'4'rn Ameri'51' coast. He '129' '91' frequently captu'796' t'43', '6' t'969'd '155' harbor. He '129' a '164' pack on '58' '46' a peddler; or '1' '240' c'34' '58' '4' Elephant '6' Castle whale. At '138' rate, '4' popular '275' '17' '58' '185' '23' sufficiently distinguish '58', '317' '4' sperm whale '516' '129' a hump '463' a sm'34'er '63'. His oil is '23' '131' valu'473'. He '129' baleen.

Thus '398's BOOK I. (Folio), '6' '56' begins BOOK II. (Octavo).
OCTAVOE'542'*—These embrace '4' whales of middling magnitude, among '265' '986' '289' be numbe'796':—I., '4' Grampus; II., '4' Black Fish; III., '4' Narwhale; IV., '4' Thra'50'r; V., '4' Killer.
*Why '14' '560' of whales is '23' denominated '4' Quarto is '131' plain. Beca'364', '313' '4' whales of '14' '619', '463' sm'34'er '169' '200' of '4' '17'mer '619', n'167''4''759' retain a proportionate '46'ness to '116' in '575', '332' '4' '560'binder's Quarto volume in '716' di'508'si'63'd '17'm '185' '23' preserve '4' shape of '4' Folio volume, '33' '4' Octavo volume '185'.
BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER I.

He is of moderate octavo size, varying '83' fifteen to t'277'y-'401' '908' in length, '6' of corresponding di'508'sions round '4' waist.

By '96' fi'50'r'508' '90' approach is regarded as premonitory of '4' advance of '4' '164' sperm whale.
BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER II. (Black Fish).—I '145' '4' popular fi'50'r'508''s '275's '17' '34' '182' fish, '17' gener'34'y '69' '36' '4' '258'. W'43' '138' '275' '308's to be vague or inexpressive, I sh'34' '99' so, '6' suggest an'173'. I do so '56', '678'ing '4' Black Fish, so-c'34'ed, beca'364' '751'ness is '4' rule among al'344' '34' whales. So, c'34' '58' '4' Hyena Whale, if '1' '142'.

T'90' whale averages '96' '578'teen or '879'een '908' in length. He is '295' in al'344' '34' latitudes.

It '185' '23' '562' to be '364'd '46' '4' blade of '4' s'429'-fish '6' '899'-fish; '463' '96' sailors '81' me '7' '4' Narwhale employs it '17' a rake in '391'ing '118' '4' bottom of '4' sea '17' '696'. Charley C'141'in '136' it '28' '364'd '17' an '972'-piercer; '17' '4' Narwhale, rising to '4' sur'352' of '4' Polar Sea, '6' '156'ing it '50'eted '31' '972', thrusts '90' horn up, '6' so '448's '209'. But '1' '51''23' '831' ei'4'r of '182' surmises to be correct. My '249' opinion is, '7' '60''167' '14' '63'-'500'd horn '289' re'34'y be '364'd by '4' Narwhale—'60''167' '7' '289' be—it '72' '658' be '131' convenient to '58' '17' a f'261'er in '504'ing pamph'123's. The Narwhale I '19' '299' c'34'ed '4' Tusked whale, '4' Horned whale, '6' '4' Unicorn whale. He is '658' a curious example of '4' Unicornism to be '295' in al'344' e'131' kingdom of animated nature. From '979' cloiste'796' '261' authors I '19' gat'43'd '7' '14' '276' sea-unicorn's horn '28' in ancient '433' regarded as '4' '164' antidote '485' poi'273', '6' as '375', preparations of it '561' im'508'se pr'972's. It '28' '516' dis'773'ed to a volatile salts '17' fainting la'474's, '4' '276' '103' '7' '4' horns of '4' male deer '36' '128'u'418'u'796' '155' hartshorn. Origin'34'y it '28' in '716'elf ac'893'ed an object of '164' curio'421'y. Black Letter '81's me '7' Sir Martin Frobi'50'r on '90' re'391' '83' '7' voyage, '74' Queen Bess '64' g'34'antly wave '49' je'35'ed h'6' to '58' '83' a '768'dow of Greenwich Palace, as '90' b'261' ship sailed d'249' '4' Thames; "'74' Sir Martin re'391'ed '83' '7' voyage," saith Black Letter, "on b'398'ed knees he '986'ed to '49' '530'ness a prodigious '192' horn of '4' Narwhale, '265' '17' a '192' period '180' hung in '4' castle at Windsor." An Irish author avers '7' '4' Earl of Le'972'ster, on b'398'ed knees, '64' '46'wise '986' to '49' '530'ness an'173' horn, pertaining to a l'6' beast of '4' unicorn nature.
The Narwhale '129' a '131' '648'sque, leopard-'46' '73', '213' of a milk-'691' ground col'119', dotted '31' round '6' ob'192' spots of '751'. His oil is '131' superior, '574' '6' '178'; '33' t'43' is '105' of it, '6' he is seldom hunted. He is '344'ly '295' in '4' circumpolar seas.
BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer).—Of '14' whale '105' is precisely '677' to '4' Nantucketer, '6' no'124' at '34' to '4' professed natura'919'. From '11' I '19' '333' of '58' at a distance, I '134' '99' '7' he '28' '39' '4' '201'ness of a grampus. He is '131' savage—a '563' of Feegee fish. He so'559'imes '726' '4' '164' Folio whales by '4' lip, '6' '621's t'43' '46' a leech, '773' '4' '240'y brute is '554' to '548'. The Killer is n'167' hunted. I n'167' '299' '11' '563' of oil he '129'. Exception '240' be '645' to '4' '275' '258''969'd upon '14' whale, on '4' ground of '716' indistinctness. For we '36' '34' '320'ers, on l'6' '6' on sea; Bona'348'es '6' Sharks included.
BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V. (Thra'50'r).—T'90' gentle'128' is famous '17' '90' tail, '265' he '364's '17' a ferule in thrashing '90' foes. He mounts '4' Folio whale's '78', '6' as he swims, he '176's '90' '962'age by flogging '58'; as '96' '351'masters '42' '549' in '4' '296' by a similar process. S'773' '759' is '677' of '4' Thra'50'r '169' of '4' Killer. Both '36' '44''749's, '140' in '4' '749''759' seas.
Thus '398's BOOK II. (Octavo), '6' begins BOOK III. (Duodecimo).
DUODECIMOE'542'—These include '4' sm'34'er whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-'843'ed Porpoise.
To '200' '94' '19' '23' '365'd speci'34'y to study '4' subject, it '289' '999' '562' st'868'ge, '7' fi'50's '23' comm'146' exceeding '492' or '401' '908' '134' be marsh'34'ed among WHALES—a '429', '265', in '4' popular '587', '194' conveys an '256' of hugeness. But '4' cr'545'ures '451' d'249' above as Duodecimoes '36' inf'34'ibly whales, by '4' terms of my definition of '11' a whale is—i.e. a sp'44'ing fish, '31' a horizontal tail.
BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise).—T'90' is '4' common porpoise '295' al'344' '34' '118' '4' globe. The '275' is of my '249' '258'owal; '17' t'43' '36' '117' '169' '63' '563' of porpoises, '6' so'559'hing '259' be d'63' to distinguish '116'. I c'34' '58' thus, beca'364' he '194' swims in hilarious shoals, '265' upon '4' b'937' sea '184' tossing '116'selves to heaven '46' caps in a F'119'th-of-July crowd. Their appea'868'ce is gener'34'y hailed '31' de'703' by '4' mariner. Full of '178' spir'716', '69' invariably '67' '83' '4' breezy '899'ows to '768'd'869'd. T'84' '36' '4' lads '7' '194' '349' '165' '4' '768'd. T'84' '36' ac'893'ed a '672'y o'508'. If '1' y'119''968' '51' '31'st'6' '291' cheers at be'956' '182' vivacious fish, '98' heaven '148' ye; '4' spirit of '152'ly '544'so'508'ess is '23' in ye. A '35'-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise '76' yield '1' '63' '68' g'34'on of '68' oil. But '4' '178' '6' delicate fluid extr'735'ed '83' '90' jaws is exceedingly valu'473'. It is in request among je'35'ers '6' '430''106'rs. Sailors '186' it on '238' h'913'. Porpoise m'545' is '68' '545'ing, '1' k'56'. It '289' n'167' '19' occur'796' to '1' '7' a porpoise sp'44's. Indeed, '90' sp'44' is so sm'34' '7' it is '23' '131' '504'ily discernible. But '4' '290' '75' '1' '19' a '365', '430' '58'; '6' '1' '76' '98' '66' '4' '164' Sperm whale '58''968' in miniature.
BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER II. (Algerine Porpoise).—A pirate. Very savage. He is '146' '295', I '54', in '4' Pacific. He is '96''11' larger '169' '4' Huzza Porpoise, '33' '137' of '4' '276' general '106'. Provoke '58', '6' he '76' buckle to a shark. I '19' l'969''796' '17' '58' '128'y '464', '33' n'167' '332' '282' '58' captu'796'.
BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-'843'ed Porpoise).—The largest '207' of Porpoise; '6' '146' '295' in '4' Pacific, so '458' as it is '677'. The '146' English '275', by '265' he '129' '479''49'to '91' de'659'ated, is '7' of '4' fi'50'rs—Right-Whale Porpoise, '83' '4' circumstance '7' he is chiefly '295' in '4' vicinity of '7' Folio. In shape, he differs in '96' degree '83' '4' Huzza Porpoise, '213' of a '759' rotund '6' jolly girth; indeed, he is of '538' a n'545' '6' gentle'128'-'46' '575'. He '129' no fins on '90' '78' ('344' '173' porpoises '19'), he '129' a '112'ly tail, '6' '708'i'508'tal Indian '495' of a hazel hue. But '90' mealy-'843' spoils '34'. Though '90' '797' '78' d'249' to '90' '500' fins is of a deep s'473', '332' a boundary '518', distinct as '4' mark in a ship's hull, c'34'ed '4' "b'40' waist," '7' '518' streaks '58' '83' stem to stern, '31' '149' separate col'119's, '751' above '6' '691' below. The '691' comprises '348' of '90' '342', '6' '4' '251' of '90' '843', '265' '408' '58' '73' as if he '97' '22' escaped '83' a felonious vi'421' to a meal-bag. A '344' '80' '6' mealy aspect! His oil is '137' '46' '7' of '4' common porpoise.
Beyond '4' DUODECIMO, '14' system '185' '23' proceed, inas'137' as '4' Porpoise is '4' sm'34'est of '4' whales. Above, '1' '19' '34' '4' Levia'169's of '23'e. But t'43' '36' a rabble of un'979', fugitive, '499'-fabulous whales, '265', as an Ameri'51' whale'128', I k'56' by re'186'ation, '33' '23' '369''34'y. I sh'34' enumerate '116' by '238' '17'e-castle appellations; '17' '999' '375' a '919' '289' be valu'473' to '670' investigators, '94' '289' comp'123'e '11' I '19' '43' '33' be'723'. If '138' of '4' '858'ing whales, sh'34' '43''180' be '808' '6' marked, '98' he '51' '504'ily be incorporated '155' '14' System, according to '90' Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; '4' Junk Whale; '4' Pudding-Headed Whale; '4' Cape Whale; '4' Leading Whale; '4' Cannon Whale; '4' Scragg Whale; '4' Coppe'796' Whale; '4' Elephant Whale; '4' Iceberg Whale; '4' Quog Whale; '4' Blue Whale; etc. From Icel'6'ic, Dutch, '6' '261' English authorities, t'43' '240' be quoted '173' '919's of un'979' whales, b'759'ed '31' '34' '128'ner of unc'44'h '275's. But I omit '116' as alto'42''49' obso'123'e; '6' '51' '321'ly '148' suspecting '116' '17' mere '602's, '597' of Levia'169'ism, '33' '659'ifying no'124'.
Fin'34'y: It '28' '892'd at '4' '44''451', '7' '14' system '72' '23' be '43', '6' at '336', '475'ed. You '51''23' '33' plainly '66' '7' I '19' '764' my '429'.

T'90' '251' '560' is '33' a draught—nay, '33' '4' draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, '6' Patience!




CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.

C'336'rning '4' '493'rs of '4' whale-craft, '14' '562's as '68' a '226' as '138' to '451' d'249' a '105' domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising '83' '4' exis'606'ce of '4' harpo'63'er cl'652' of '493'rs, a cl'652' un'677' of '239' in '138' '173' marine '169' '4' whale-fleet.
The large importance attached to '4' harpo'63'er's vocation is evinced by '4' '418', '7' origin'34'y in '4' '261' Dutch Fi'50'ry, '149' centuries '6' '117' '414', '4' com'128'd of a whale ship '28' '23' '94'lly lodged in '4' '369' '56' c'34'ed '4' captain, '33' '28' divided '592'ween '58' '6' an '493'r c'34'ed '4' Specksnyder. Liter'34'y '14' '429' '410' Fat-Cutter; usage, '60''167', in '75' '721'e it equivalent to Chief Harpo'63'er. In '200' '433', '4' captain's authority '28' '426'ricted to '4' navigation '6' general '128'age'508't of '4' vessel; '313' '118' '4' whale-hunting de'348''508't '6' '34' '716' c'336'rns, '4' Specksnyder or Chief Harpo'63'er reigned supreme. In '4' British Greenl'6' Fi'50'ry, '447' '4' corrupted title of Specksi'63'er, '14' '261' Dutch '141'icial is s'773' retained, '33' '90' '17'mer dignity is sadly ab'885'd. At '986' he '868'ks simply as senior Harpo'63'er; '6' as '375', is '33' '63' of '4' captain's '117' inferior subalterns. N'167''4''759', as upon '4' '68' conduct of '4' harpo'63'ers '4' success of a whaling voyage largely dep'398's, '6' '317' in '4' Ameri'51' Fi'50'ry he is '23' '146' an '425' '493'r in '4' boat, '33' '447' '979' circumstances ('168' '430'es on a whaling ground) '4' com'128'd of '4' ship's deck is '516' '90'; t'43''17'e '4' gr'6' political maxim of '4' sea de'128'ds, '7' he '134' nomin'34'y '349' a'348' '83' '4' '508' '165' '4' mast, '6' be in '96' '103' distingui'50'd as '238' professional superior; '463' '194', by '116', familiarly regarded as '238' social equal.
Now, '4' gr'6' distinction drawn '592'ween '493'r '6' '128' at sea, is '14'—'4' '171' '349's aft, '4' '181' '17''869'd. Hence, in whale-ships '6' merchant'508' a'46', '4' mates '19' '238' quarters '31' '4' captain; '6' so, '111', in '344' of '4' Ameri'51' whalers '4' harpo'63'ers '36' lodged in '4' '180' '348' of '4' ship. That is to '99', '69' '101' '238' meals in '4' captain's cabin, '6' '503' in a '226' indirectly communicating '31' it.
Though '4' '192' period of a Sou'4'rn whaling voyage (by '458' '4' '192'est of '34' voyages '56' or '167' '721'e by '128'), '4' peculiar perils of it, '6' '4' community of inte'426' prevailing among a '624', '34' of '94'm, '530' or low, dep'398' '17' '238' prof'716', '23' upon '950'ed wages, '33' upon '238' common '672', to'42''49' '31' '238' common vigilance, intrepidity, '6' '321' '176'; '463' '34' '182' '124's do in '96' '390's '606'd to be'42' a '759' rigorous discip'518' '169' in merchant'508' gener'34'y; '332', n'167' '241' '60' '137' '46' an '261' Mesopotamian '250' '182' whale'508' '289', in '96' primitive instances, '349' to'42''49'; '17' '34' '7', '4' punctilious externals, at '402', of '4' quarter-deck '36' seldom materi'34'y '825'ed, '6' in no instance d'63' '170'. Indeed, '128'y '36' '4' Nantucket ships in '265' '1' '76' '66' '4' skipper parading '90' quarter-deck '31' an e'399'd gr'6'eur '23' sur'962'ed in '138' military navy; nay, extorting al'344' as '137' '44''869'd homage as if he wore '4' imperial purple, '6' '23' '4' shabbiest of pi'202'-c'202'h.
And '463' of '34' '508' '4' moody captain of '4' Pequod '28' '4' '402' '145'n to '7' '563' of sh'34''969'st '652'umption; '6' '463' '4' '146' homage he '167' ex'735'ed, '28' implicit, instantaneous obe'474'nce; '463' he requi'796' no '128' to re'367' '4' shoes '83' '90' '908' ere '761'ping upon '4' quarter-deck; '6' '463' t'43' '85' '464' '74', o'768'g to peculiar circumstances connected '31' '140'ts '43''180' to be detailed, he ad'926'ed '116' in unusual terms, whe'4'r of condescension or in terrorem, or '173'wise; '332' '140' Captain Ahab '28' by no '410' unobservant of '4' paramount '17'ms '6' usages of '4' sea.
Nor, '760', '76' it fail to be '140'tu'34'y perceived, '7' '528' '200' '17'ms '6' usages, as it '85', he so'559'imes m'257'ed '58''968'; incident'34'y '380' '364' of '116' '17' '173' '6' '117' '988' '398's '169' '69' '85' legitimately in'606'ded to subserve. That '979' sultanism of '90' brain, '265' '97' '173'wise in a '68' degree remained un'128'ifested; '209' '200' '17'ms '7' '276' sultanism be'246' in'324'nate in an irresistible dictatorship.

T'90' it is, '7' '17' '167' '184's God's '354' princes of '4' Empire '83' '4' '296''s hustings; '6' '224's '4' '530'est hon'119's '7' '14' '769' '51' '145', to '200' '508' '94' be'67' famous '117' '209' '238' infinite inferiority to '4' '667' hidden h'6'ful of '4' Divine Inert, '169' '209' '238' undoubted superiority '118' '4' '314' level of '4' m'652'.

It is noon; '6' Dough-Boy, '4' ste'869'd, thrusting '90' pale loaf-of-b'504' '352' '83' '4' cabin-s'537'tle, announces '484' to '90' lord '6' master; '94', '812' in '4' lee quarter-boat, '129' '22' '91' '409' an observation of '4' sun; '6' is '56' mutely reckoning '4' latitude on '4' smooth, med'34'ion-shaped tab'123', reserved '17' '7' daily purpose on '4' upper '348' of '90' ivory leg. From '90' comp'123'e inat'606'tion to '4' tidings, '1' '72' '54' '7' moody Ahab '97' '23' '299' '90' '508'ial. But '986'ly, '756'ing '330' of '4' mizen shrouds, he s'768'gs '58''968' to '4' deck, '6' in an '140', unexhilarated '915', '99'ing, "Dinner, '197' Starbuck," disappears '155' '4' cabin.
When '4' '181' echo of '90' sultan's '761' '129' '474'd '170', '6' Starbuck, '4' '171' Emir, '129' e'131' '385' to '803' '7' he is s'545'ed, '98' Starbuck ro'364's '83' '90' '935'ude, '726' a '360' '391's '549' '4' '519'ks, '6', '180' a grave peep '155' '4' binnacle, '415', '31' '96' '678' of pleasantness, "Dinner, '197' Stubb," '6' desc'398's '4' s'537'tle. The '347' Emir lounges '39' '4' rigging a'313', '6' '98' s'703'ly shaking '4' main brace, to '66' whe'4'r it '76' be '34' '40' '31' '7' '425' rope, he '46'wise '726' up '4' '261' burden, '6' '31' a rapid "Dinner, '197' Fl'257'," '858's '180' '90' p'796'ecessors.
But '4' third Emir, '56' '66'ing '58''968' '34' al'63' on '4' quarter-deck, '562's to '174' re'596'ved '83' '96' curious '426'raint; '17', tipping '34' '563's of kno'768'g '768'ks in '34' '563's of directions, '6' kicking '141' '90' shoes, he strikes '155' a sharp '33' noise'759' squ'34' of a hornpipe '40' '118' '4' Gr'6' Turk's '342'; '6' '98', by a dexterous sl'879', pitching '90' cap up '155' '4' mizen'739' '17' a '50'lf, he '547' d'249' rollicking so '458' at '402' as he remains visible '83' '4' deck, r'167'sing '34' '173' processions, by b'847'ing up '4' rear '31' '886'. But ere '761'ping '155' '4' cabin '450''103' below, he pa'364's, ships a '212' '352' alto'42''49', '6', '98', indep'398'ent, hilarious '105' Fl'257' enters King Ahab's presence, in '4' char'735'er of Abjectus, or '4' Slave.
It is '23' '4' '402' among '4' st'868'ge '124's b'796' by '4' in'606'se artificialness of sea-usages, '7' '313' in '4' '422' '769' of '4' deck '96' '493'rs '76', upon provocation, bear '116'selves b'261'ly '6' defyingly '243' to'869'ds '238' com'128'der; '332', '606' to '63', '123' '200' '131' '493'rs '4' '290' mo'508't go d'249' to '238' customary '484' in '7' '276' com'128'der's cabin, '6' '688''103' '238' in'141'ensive, '23' to '99' deprecatory '6' humble '769' to'869'ds '58', as he '421's at '4' '342' of '4' t'473'; '14' is marvellous, so'559'imes '344' comical. W'43''17'e '14' difference? A '293'? Perhaps '23'. To '19' '91' Belshazzar, King of Babylon; '6' to '19' '91' Belshazzar, '23' haughtily '33' c'119'teously, t'43'in '658' '259' '19' '91' '96' '678' of mundane gr'6'eur. But he '94' in '4' '40'ly regal '6' in'81'igent spirit pre'500's '118' '90' '249' '988' '484'-t'473' of invited guests, '7' '128''s unch'34'enged '637' '6' dominion of individual influence '17' '4' '75'; '7' '128''s royalty of '892' t'868'sc'398's Belshazzar's, '17' Belshazzar '28' '23' '4' '164'est. Who '129' '33' '336' dined '90' fri'398's, '129' tasted '11' it is to be Caesar. It is a witc'49'y of social czarship '265' t'43' is no '31'st'6'ing. Now, if to '14' con'500'ration '1' superadd '4' '141'icial supremacy of a ship-master, '98', by inference, '1' '76' derive '4' ca'364' of '7' peculiarity of sea-'139' '22' '508'ti'63'd.
Over '90' ivory-inlaid t'473', Ahab pre'500'd '46' a mute, '128'ed sea-lion on '4' '691' coral b'356', surrounded by '90' '869''46' '33' s'773' deferential cubs. In '90' '249' proper '391', '356' '493'r '154'ed to be served. T'84' '85' as '105' '566' '165' Ahab; '6' '332', in Ahab, t'43' '562'ed '23' to lurk '4' sm'34'est social arrogance. With '63' '241', '238' in'606't '495' '34' fas'606'ed upon '4' '261' '128''s knife, as he '324'ved '4' chief dish '165' '58'. I do '23' '803' '7' '17' '4' '296' '69' '72' '19' profaned '7' mo'508't '31' '4' s'703'est observation, '140' upon so neutral a '739'ic as '4' wea'4'r. No! And '74' r'356'ing '44' '90' knife '6' '17'k, '592'ween '265' '4' sl'972' of beef '28' locked, Ahab t'43'by moti'63'd Starbuck's p'399' to'869'ds '58', '4' mate received '90' m'545' as '463' receiving alms; '6' '537' it '606'derly; '6' a '105' '319'ed if, per'365', '4' knife grazed '485' '4' p'399'; '6' chewed it noise'759'ly; '6' sw'34''969'd it, '23' '327' circumspection. For, '46' '4' Coronation banquet at F'868'k'17't, w'43' '4' Ger'128' Emperor pro'295'ly dines '31' '4' s'140' Imperial Electors, so '182' cabin meals '85' '96''60' solemn meals, ea'606' in awful silence; '6' '332' at t'473' '261' Ahab '17''217'e '23' conversation; '146' he '58''968' '28' dumb. What a re'596'f it '28' to choking Stubb, '74' a rat '721'e a sudden racket in '4' '330' below. And '719' '105' Fl'257', he '28' '4' '507'est '273', '6' '105' '311' of '14' '854'y '250' '348'y. His '85' '4' shinb'913' of '4' sa'518' beef; '90' '72' '19' '91' '4' drum'856's. For Fl'257' to '19' presumed to '148' '58''968', '14' '259' '19' '562'ed to '58' tantamount to larceny in '4' '171' degree. Had he '148'ed '58''968' at '7' t'473', doubt'759', n'167' '117' '72' he '19' '91' '473' to '330' '90' '342' up in '14' h'913't '296'; n'167''4''759', st'868'ge to '99', Ahab n'167' '17''217'e '58'. And '97' Fl'257' '148'ed '58''968', '4' '365's '85' Ahab '97' n'167' so '137' as '23''972'd it. Least of '34', '64' Fl'257' presume to '148' '58''968' to '33'ter. Whe'4'r he '147' '4' '249'ers of '4' ship denied it to '58', on ac'893' of '716' c'202'ting '90' '574', sunny complexion; or whe'4'r he deemed '7', on so '192' a voyage in '375' market'759' '604's, '33'ter '28' at a premium, '6' t'43''17'e '28' '23' '17' '58', a subaltern; '60''167' it '28', Fl'257', alas! '28' a '33'ter'759' '128'!
An'173' '124'. Fl'257' '28' '4' '181' '369' d'249' at '4' '484', '6' Fl'257' is '4' '171' '128' up. Con'500'r! For '43'by Fl'257''s '484' '28' '217'ly jammed in '378' of '75'. Starbuck '6' Stubb '312' '97' '4' '319' of '58'; '6' '332' '69' '516' '19' '4' privilege of lounging in '4' rear. If Stubb '140', '94' is '33' a peg '530'er '169' Fl'257', '308's to '19' '33' a sm'34' appetite, '6' '358' s'60's symptoms of concluding '90' re'536', '98' Fl'257' '259' '258'ir '58''968', he '76' '23' '42' '117' '169' '291' '843'fuls '7' '183'; '17' it is '485' holy usage '17' Stubb to precede Fl'257' to '4' deck. T'43''17'e it '28' '7' Fl'257' '336' '774'ted in '988', '7' '167' '317' he '97' arisen to '4' dignity of an '493'r, '83' '7' mo'508't he '97' n'167' '677' '11' it '28' to be '173'wise '169' hungry, '117' or '759'. For '11' he ate '64' '23' so '137' re'596've '90' hunger, as '184' it immortal in '58'. Peace '6' satis'418'ion, '147' Fl'257', '19' '17' '167' de'348'ed '83' my stomach. I am an '493'r; '33', '60' I '392' I '87' fish a '437' of '261'-fashi'63'd beef in '4' '17'ecastle, as I '364'd to '74' I '28' '165' '4' mast. T'43''s '4' fru'716' of promotion '56'; t'43''s '4' vanity of glory: t'43''s '4' insanity of '139'! Be'500's, if it '85' so '7' '138' mere sailor of '4' Pequod '97' a grudge '485' Fl'257' in Fl'257''s '141'icial capa'709', '34' '7' sailor '97' to do, in '619' to obtain ample vengeance, '28' to go aft at '484'-'75', '6' '42' a peep at Fl'257' '209' '4' cabin sky-'703', '812' silly '6' dumfo'447'ed '165' awful Ahab.
Now, Ahab '6' '90' '291' mates '17'med '11' '289' be c'34'ed '4' '171' t'473' in '4' Pequod's cabin. After '238' de'348'ure, '409' '226' in inverted '619' to '238' arrival, '4' '51'vas c'202'h '28' clea'796', or '743' '28' '426'o'796' to '96' hurried '619' by '4' p'34'id ste'869'd. And '98' '4' '291' harpo'63'ers '85' bidden to '4' feast, '69' '213' '716' residuary legatees. T'84' '721'e a '563' of temporary servants' h'34' of '4' '530' '6' '240'y cabin.
In st'868'ge contrast to '4' '321'ly toler'473' constraint '6' '275''759' invisible do'462'e'847's of '4' captain's t'473', '28' '4' '797' '324'e-'523' l'972'nse '6' ease, '4' al'344' f'868'tic democracy of '200' inferior '947'ows '4' harpo'63'ers. While '238' masters, '4' mates, '562'ed '423' of '4' '602' of '4' hinges of '238' '249' jaws, '4' harpo'63'ers chewed '238' '696' '31' '375' a relish '7' t'43' '28' a report to it. T'84' dined '46' lords; '69' filled '238' bel'596's '46' Indian ships '34' '183' loading '31' sp'972's. Such por'606'tous appetites '97' Queequeg '6' Tashtego, '7' to fill '44' '4' va'51'cies '721'e by '4' previous re'536', of'606' '4' pale Dough-Boy '28' fain to b'847' on a '164' '960'on of salt-junk, '562'ingly quarried '44' of '4' solid ox. And if he '85' '23' '349'ly '39' it, if he '64' '23' go '31' a nimble hop-skip-'6'-jump, '98' Tashtego '97' an ungentle'128'ly '103' of accelerating '58' by darting a '17'k at '90' '78', harpoon-wise. And '336' Daggoo, seized '31' a sudden humor, '652'isted Dough-Boy's memory by snatching '58' up bodily, '6' thrusting '90' '342' '155' a '164' empty wooden trenc'49', '313' Tashtego, knife in h'6', began laying '44' '4' circle preliminary to scalping '58'. He '28' natur'34'y a '131' nervous, shudde'847' '563' of '105' '947'ow, '14' b'504'-'352'd ste'869'd; '4' progeny of a bankrupt baker '6' a '467' nurse. And '11' '31' '4' st'6'ing spectacle of '4' '751' terrific Ahab, '6' '4' periodical tumultuous vi'421'ations of '182' '291' savages, Dough-Boy's '251' '139' '28' '63' continual lip-quiver. Comm'146', '180' '66'ing '4' harpo'63'ers furni'50'd '31' '34' '124's '69' de'128'ded, he '72' escape '83' '238' clutches '155' '90' '105' pan'244' adjoining, '6' fear'597'y peep '44' at '116' '209' '4' blinds of '716' '450', '773' '34' '28' '118'.
It '28' a sight to '66' Queequeg s'545'ed '118' '485' Tashtego, opposing '90' filed teeth to '4' Indian's: crosswise to '116', Daggoo s'545'ed on '4' '983', '17' a bench '72' '19' '561' '90' '230'se-plumed '342' to '4' low '324''518's; at e'131' motion of '90' colossal limbs, '380' '4' low cabin frame'176' to shake, as '74' an Afri'51' elephant '547' '962'enger in a ship. But '17' '34' '14', '4' '164' negro '28' '683''597'y abstemious, '23' to '99' dainty. It '562'ed '321'ly '622' '7' by '375' comparatively sm'34' '843'fuls he '87' '184' up '4' vitality diff'364'd '209' so b'937', '960'onial, '6' superb a '369'. But, doubt'759', '14' noble savage fed '777' '6' d'868'k deep of '4' abounding ele'508't of '769'; '6' '209' '90' di'399'd nostrils snuffed in '4' sublime '139' of '4' '296's. Not by beef or by b'504', '36' giants '721'e or n'119'i'50'd. But Queequeg, he '97' a mortal, '960''960'ic smack of '4' lip in '545'ing—an ugly '602' '243'—so '137' so, '7' '4' trembling Dough-Boy al'344' '720' to '66' whe'4'r '138' marks of teeth lurked in '90' '249' lean arms. And '74' he '72' '230' Tashtego singing '44' '17' '58' to produce '58''968', '7' '90' b'913' '240' be '512'ed, '4' '910'-witted ste'869'd '34' '33' shatte'796' '4' crockery '621'ing round '58' in '4' pan'244', by '90' sudden f'716' of '4' palsy. Nor '64' '4' whetst'63' '265' '4' harpo'63'ers '324'ried in '238' pockets, '17' '238' lances '6' '173' weapons; '6' '31' '265' whetst'913', at '484', '69' '72' os'606'tatiously sharpen '238' knives; '7' grating '602' '64' '23' at '34' '606'd to t'868'quillize '719' Dough-Boy. How '87' he '353' '7' in '90' Isl'6' '433', Queequeg, '17' '63', '259' '658' '19' '91' guilty of '96' '776'ous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! '321' f'36's '4' '691' '154'er '94' '154's upon '51'nibals. Not a napkin '134' he '324'ry on '90' arm, '33' a buckler. In '68' '75', '463', to '90' '164' de'703', '4' '291' salt-sea '869'riors '72' rise '6' de'348'; to '90' c'796'ulous, f'473'-monge'847' ears, '34' '238' martial b'913' jingling in '116' at e'131' '761', '46' Moorish sci'559'ars in scab'960'ds.
But, '463' '182' '960''960'ians dined in '4' cabin, '6' nomin'34'y '349'd t'43'; s'773', '213' '138''124' '33' sedentary in '238' hab'716', '69' '85' s'324'cely '167' in it '722' at meal'464', '6' '22' '165' '503'ing-'75', '74' '69' '962'ed '209' it to '238' '249' peculiar quarters.
In '14' '63' '301', Ahab '562'ed no '722'ion to '344' Ameri'51' whale captains, '94', as a '451', '743' inc'518' to '4' opinion '7' by '40's '4' ship's cabin be'192's to '116'; '6' '7' it is by c'119'tesy al'63' '7' '138''618' '234' is, at '138' '75', permitted t'43'. So '7', in '272' '350', '4' mates '6' harpo'63'ers of '4' Pequod '240' '117' properly be '136' to '19' '349'd '44' of '4' cabin '169' in it. For '74' '69' '64' enter it, it '28' so'559'hing as a '811'-'450' enters a ho'364'; '391'ing in'869'ds '17' a mo'508't, '146' to be '391'ed '44' '4' '290'; '6', as a per'128'ent '124', residing in '4' '422' '769'. Nor '64' '69' '521' '137' '43'by; in '4' cabin '28' no companionship; soci'34'y, Ahab '28' inaccessible. Though nomin'34'y included in '4' census of '917''606'dom, he '28' s'773' an a'596'n to it. He '349'd in '4' '296', as '4' '181' of '4' Grisly Bears '349'd in '451'tled Miss'119'i. And as '74' Sp'847' '6' Summer '97' de'348'ed, '7' wild Logan of '4' woods, burying '58''968' in '4' hollow of a tree, '349'd '44' '4' '768'ter t'43', sucking '90' '249' paws; so, in '90' incle'508't, '60'ling '261' age, Ahab's soul, '472' up in '4' caved t'366'k of '90' '618', t'43' fed upon '4' sullen paws of '716' gloom!




CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.

Now, as '4' '355' of st'6'ing mast-'342's, ashore or afloat, is a '131' ancient '6' '928' '63', '123' us in '96' mea'115' expatiate '43'. I '101' it, '7' '4' ear'596'st st'6'ers of mast-'342's '85' '4' '261' Egyptians; beca'364', in '34' my researches, I '156' '697' prior to '116'. For '463' '238' progenitors, '4' builders of Babel, '259' doubt'759', by '238' t'969'r, '19' in'606'ded to rear '4' loftiest mast-'342' in '34' Asia, or Africa ei'4'r; '332' (ere '4' final truck '28' '186' to it) as '7' '164' st'63' mast of '238's '289' be '136' to '19' g'63' by '4' board, in '4' d'504' gale of God's wrath; t'43''17'e, we '51''23' '145' '182' Babel builders priority '118' '4' Egyptians. And '7' '4' Egyptians '85' a nation of mast-'342' st'6'ers, is an '652'ertion based upon '4' general be'596'f among archaeologists, '7' '4' '171' pyramids '85' '295'ed '17' astronomical purposes: a '4'ory singularly supported by '4' peculiar st'769'-'46' '17'mation of '34' '492' '500's of '200' edif'972's; w'43'by, '31' prodigious '192' upliftings of '238' legs, '200' '261' astronomers '85' wont to mount to '4' apex, '6' sing '44' '17' '212' stars; '140' as '4' '73'-'44's of a modern ship sing '44' '17' a sail, or a whale '22' bea'847' in sight. In Saint Stylites, '4' famous '917'tian '49'mit of '261' '464', '94' built '58' a lofty st'63' pillar in '4' desert '6' '953' '4' '251' latter portion of '90' '139' on '716' summit, hoisting '90' '696' '83' '4' ground '31' a tackle; in '58' we '19' a remark'473' instance of a d'976''759' st'6'er-of-mast-'342's; '94' '28' '23' to be '698'n '83' '90' '226' by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; '33' valiantly facing e'131''124' '44' to '4' '181', liter'34'y '474'd at '90' post.

The '736'y O'515' '81's us, '7' in '4' '865' '464' of '4' whale fi'50'ry, ere ships '85' regularly launched in pursuit of '4' '544', '4' '151' of '7' isl'6' erected lofty spars '549' '4' sea-coast, to '265' '4' '73'-'44's asc'398'ed by '410' of nailed cl'545's, so'559'hing as fowls go '994' in a hen-ho'364'.

But '14' custom '129' '56' be'67' obso'123'e; '391' we '98' to '4' '63' proper mast-'342', '7' of a whale-ship at sea. The '291' mast-'342's '36' '764' '128'ned '83' sun-rise to sun-'451'; '4' sea'508' '409' '238' regular '391's (as at '4' helm), '6' re'596'ving '356' '173' e'131' '149' '520'. In '4' serene wea'4'r of '4' tropics it is exceedingly pleasant '4' mast-'342'; nay, to a '710'y meditative '128' it is de'703'ful. T'43' '1' st'6', a hund'796' '908' above '4' silent decks, striding '549' '4' deep, as if '4' masts '85' gigantic stilts, '313' ben'545'h '1' '6' '592'ween y'119' legs, as it '85', swim '4' hugest monsters of '4' sea, '140' as ships '336' sailed '592'ween '4' boots of '4' famous Colossus at '261' Rhodes. T'43' '1' st'6', '387' in '4' infinite series of '4' sea, '31' no'124' ruffled '33' '4' waves. The t'868'ced ship indolently rolls; '4' drowsy trade '768'ds blow; e'131''124' resolves '1' '155' languor. For '4' '344' '348', in '14' tropic whaling '139', a sublime un'140'tfulness invests '1'; '1' '230' no '212's; '504' no gazettes; extras '31' '319'ling ac'893's of common'226's n'167' delude '1' '155' unnecessary excite'508'ts; '1' '230' of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; f'34' of stocks; '36' n'167' '461'd '31' '4' '147' of '11' '1' sh'34' '19' '17' '484'—'17' '34' y'119' meals '17' '291' '266' '6' '117' '36' snugly st'969'd in c'257's, '6' y'119' '899' of f'36' is immut'473'.
In '63' of '200' sou'4'rn whales'508', on a '192' '291' or '492' '266'' voyage, as of'606' '308's, '4' sum of '4' various '520' '1' sp'398' at '4' mast-'342' '72' amount to s'167'al '797' '611'. And it is '137' to be deplo'796' '7' '4' '226' to '265' '1' devote so con'500'r'473' a portion of '4' '251' term of y'119' natural '139', '134' be so sadly destitute of '138''124' approaching to a cosy inha'437'iveness, or adapted to breed a com'17't'473' localness of '174'ing, '375' as pertains to a '515', a hammock, a '230'se, a '708'ry '990', a pulpit, a coach, or '138' '173' of '200' sm'34' '6' snug contrivances in '265' '508' temporarily iso'399' '116'selves. Y'119' '344' usual '378' of perch is '4' '342' of '4' t' g'34'ant-mast, w'43' '1' st'6' upon '149' thin par'34'el '856's (al'344' peculiar to whale'508') c'34'ed '4' t' g'34'ant cross-trees. Here, tossed '39' by '4' sea, '4' beginner '174's '39' as cosy as he '72' st'6'ing on a bull's horns. To be '115', in '690' wea'4'r '1' '289' '324'ry y'119' ho'364' aloft '31' '1', in '4' shape of a '430'-coat; '33' properly '613'ing '4' thickest '430'-coat is no '117' of a ho'364' '169' '4' unclad '618'; '17' as '4' soul is glued in'500' of '716' fleshy tabernacle, '6' '51''23' '523'ly '367' '39' in it, nor '140' '367' '44' of it, '327' '573' '164' risk of perishing ('46' an igno'868't pilgrim crossing '4' s'56'y Alps in '768'ter); so a '430'-coat is '23' so '137' of a ho'364' as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing '1'. You '51''23' '186' a '50'lf or chest of drawers in y'119' '618', '6' no '117' '51' '1' '106' a convenient clo'451' of y'119' '430'-coat.
C'336'rning '34' '14', it is '137' to be deplo'796' '7' '4' mast-'342's of a sou'4'rn whale ship '36' unprovided '31' '200' envi'473' '105' '606'ts or pulp'716', c'34'ed crow's-nests, in '265' '4' '73'-'44's of a Greenl'6' whaler '36' '711'ed '83' '4' incle'508't wea'4'r of '4' frozen seas. In '4' '522''500' narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled "A Voyage among '4' Icebergs, in quest of '4' Greenl'6' Whale, '6' incident'34'y '17' '4' re-disco'131' of '4' Lost Icel'6'ic Colonies of Old Greenl'6';" in '14' admir'473' volume, '34' st'6'ers of mast-'342's '36' furni'50'd '31' a charmingly circumstantial ac'893' of '4' '98' recently invented crow's-nest of '4' Glacier, '265' '28' '4' '275' of Captain Sleet's '68' craft. He c'34'ed it '4' Sleet's crow's-nest, in hon'119' of '58''968'; he '213' '4' original inventor '6' pa'606'tee, '6' '523' '83' '34' ridiculous false delicacy, '6' '956' '7' if we c'34' '119' '249' '566' '180' '119' '249' '275's (we '233's '213' '4' original inventors '6' pa'606'tees), so '46'wise '134' we denominate '180' '119'selves '138' '173' apparatus we '289' be'42'. In shape, '4' Sleet's crow's-nest is so'559'hing '46' a large tierce or pipe; it is '422' above, '60''167', w'43' it is furni'50'd '31' a mov'473' '500'-screen to '184' to '768'd'869'd of y'119' '342' in a '321' gale. Being '950'ed on '4' summit of '4' mast, '1' asc'398' '155' it '209' a '105' trap-hatch in '4' bottom. On '4' '180' '500', or '500' '290' '4' stern of '4' ship, is a com'17't'473' s'545', '31' a locker '447'n'545'h '17' umbrellas, com'17'ters, '6' coats. In '569' is a lea'4'r rack, in '265' to '184' y'119' '613'ing trumpet, pipe, telescope, '6' '173' nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in '369' s'111'd '90' mast-'342' in '14' crow's-nest of '90', he '81's us '7' he '194' '97' a rifle '31' '58' ('516' '950'ed in '4' rack), to'42''49' '31' a powder fl'257' '6' s'576', '17' '4' purpose of popping '141' '4' stray narwhales, or vag'868't sea unicorns infesting '200' '604's; '17' '1' '51''23' success'597'y '855' at '116' '83' '4' deck o'768'g to '4' resistance of '4' '604', '33' to '855' d'249' upon '116' is a '131' '465' '124'. Now, it '28' plainly a labor of '112' '17' Captain Sleet to describe, as he '185', '34' '4' '105' detailed conveniences of '90' crow's-nest; '33' '463' he so enlarges upon '128'y of '182', '6' '463' he tr'545's us to a '131' scientific ac'893' of '90' experi'508'ts in '14' crow's-nest, '31' a sm'34' com'962' he '764' t'43' '17' '4' purpose of '893'er'735'ing '4' errors resulting '83' '11' is c'34'ed '4' "local attr'735'ion" of '34' binnacle magnets; an error ascrib'473' to '4' horizontal vicinity of '4' iron in '4' ship's '519'ks, '6' in '4' Glacier's '390', '760', to t'43' '305' '91' so '128'y '785'n-d'249' '751'smiths among '49' crew; I '99', '7' '463' '4' Captain is '131' discreet '6' scientific '43', '332', '17' '34' '90' '819'ed "binnacle deviations," "azimuth com'962' observations," '6' "approximate errors," he '359' '131' '35', Captain Sleet, '7' he '28' '23' so '137' immersed in '200' pro'295' magnetic meditations, as to fail '213' attr'735'ed occasion'34'y to'869'ds '7' '35' repleni'50'd '105' '390'-bottle, so n'972'ly tucked in on '63' '500' of '90' crow's nest, '31'in '454' r'356' of '90' h'6'. Though, upon '4' '251', I '164'ly admire '6' '140' '112' '4' brave, '4' h'913't, '6' '819'ed Captain; '332' I '101' it '131' ill of '58' '7' he '134' so utterly ignore '7' '390'-bottle, '66'ing '11' a faithful fri'398' '6' com'17'ter it '259' '19' '91', '313' '31' mit'606'ed fingers '6' hooded '342' he '28' studying '4' ma'116'atics aloft t'43' in '7' bird's nest '31'in '291' or '492' perches of '4' pole.
But if we Sou'4'rn whale-fi'50'rs '36' '23' so snugly ho'364'd aloft as Captain Sleet '6' '90' Greenl'6''508' '85'; '332' '7' disadvantage is '164'ly '893'er-balanced by '4' widely contrasting serenity of '200' seductive seas in '265' we S'44'h fi'50'rs '344'ly float. For '63', I '364'd to lounge up '4' rigging '131' lei'115'ly, '426'ing in '4' '739' to '19' a chat '31' Queequeg, or '138' '63' '234' '141' duty '94'm I '240' '156' t'43'; '98' asc'398'ing a '105' '103' fur'4'r, '6' thro'768'g a lazy leg '118' '4' '739'-sail yard, '101' a preliminary view of '4' '604'y '536'ures, '6' so at '181' mount to my ultimate destination.
Let me '106' a '817' breast of it '43', '6' f'868'kly '774' '7' I '764' '33' '120' guard. With '4' '293' of '4' universe revolving in me, '60' '87' I—'213' '269' comp'123'ely to '302' at '375' a '147'-eng'398'e'847' altitude—'60' '87' I '33' '703'ly '330' my obligations to observe '34' whale-ships' st'6'ing '619's, "Keep y'119' wea'4'r '784' '422', '6' sing '44' e'131' '75'."

CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.

(Enter Ahab: Then, '34')
It '28' '23' a '164' '313' '180' '4' af'807' of '4' pipe, '7' '63' '339' '940'ly '180' '448''692', Ahab, as '28' '90' wont, asc'398'ed '4' cabin-gang'103' to '4' deck. T'43' '344' sea-captains usu'34'y '459' at '7' '612', as '893'ry gentle'508', '180' '4' '276' meal, '101' a '360' '391's in '4' garden.
Soon '90' steady, ivory st'852' '28' '299', as to '6' fro he paced '90' '261' rounds, upon '519'ks so familiar to '90' t'504', '7' '69' '85' '34' '118' dented, '46' geological st'913', '31' '4' peculiar mark of '90' '459'. Did '1' '950'edly gaze, '111', upon '7' rib'515' '6' dented brow; t'43' '516', '1' '72' '66' s'773' st'868'ger foot-prints—'4' foot-prints of '90' '63' un'503'ing, '167'-pacing '147'.
But on '4' occasion in '455', '200' dents '720' deeper, '140' as '90' nervous '761' '7' '339' '269' a deeper mark. And, so '597' of '90' '147' '28' Ahab, '7' at e'131' uni'17'm '391' '7' he '721'e, '56' at '4' main-mast '6' '56' at '4' binnacle, '1' '87' al'344' '66' '7' '147' '391' in '58' as he '391'ed, '6' pace in '58' as he paced; so comp'123'ely possessing '58', indeed, '7' it '34' '33' '562'ed '4' in'869'd mould of e'131' '44'er '367''508't.
"D'ye mark '58', Fl'257'?" w'90'pe'796' Stubb; "'4' chick '55' in '58' pecks '4' s'245'. 'T'76' '358' be '44'."
The '520' wore on;—Ahab '56' '472' up '31'in '90' cabin; anon, pacing '4' deck, '31' '4' '276' in'606'se bi'61'ry of purpose in '90' aspect.
It drew '958' '4' '452' of '183'. Suddenly he '246' to a halt by '4' bul'869'ks, '6' inserting '90' b'63' leg '155' '4' auger-hole t'43', '6' '31' '63' h'6' grasping a shroud, he '619'ed Starbuck to '642' e'131''618' aft.
"Sir!" '136' '4' mate, astoni'50'd at an '619' seldom or n'167' '145'n on ship-board '722' in '96' extraordinary '390'.
"S'398' e'131''618' aft," rep'545'ed Ahab. "Mast-'342's, t'43'! '67' d'249'!"
When '4' '797' ship's '624' '85' '652'514'bled, '6' '31' curious '6' '23' '94'lly unapprehensive '352's, '85' '784'ing '58', '17' he '720' '23' un'46' '4' wea'4'r horizon '74' a storm is '260' up, Ahab, '180' rapidly glancing '118' '4' bul'869'ks, '6' '98' darting '90' '495' among '4' crew, '319'ed '83' '90' st'6''378'; '6' as '463' '23' a soul '85' nigh '58' resumed '90' heavy '391's upon '4' deck. With bent '342' '6' '499'-slouched hat he continued to pace, un'241'ful of '4' '909' w'90'pe'847' among '4' '508'; '773' Stubb cautiously w'90'pe'796' to Fl'257', '7' Ahab '259' '19' summ'63'd '116' t'43' '17' '4' purpose of witnessing a pedestrian f'545'. But '14' '64' '23' '181' '192'. Vehe'508'tly pa'970', he cried:—
"What do ye do '74' ye '66' a whale, '508'?"
"Sing '44' '17' '58'!" '28' '4' impulsive rejoinder '83' a score of '801''515' '915's.
"Good!" cried Ahab, '31' a wild approval in '90' t'913'; observing '4' '374'y animation '155' '265' '90' un'741'ed '455' '97' so magnetic'34'y '687'n '116'.
"And '11' do ye '290', '508'?"
"L'969'r '170', '6' '180' '58'!"
"And '11' tune is it ye '732' to, '508'?"
"A '314' whale or a stove boat!"
More '6' '117' st'868'gely '6' fiercely '431' '6' approving, grew '4' coun'606'ance of '4' '261' '128' at e'131' sh'44'; '313' '4' mariners began to gaze curiously at '356' '173', as if marvelling '60' it '28' '7' '69' '116'selves be'246' so excited at '375' '562'ingly purpose'759' '681'.
But, '69' '85' '34' eagerness '158', as Ahab, '56' '499'-revolving in '90' pivot-hole, '31' '63' h'6' r'356'ing '530' up a shroud, '6' tightly, al'344' convulsively grasping it, ad'926'ed '116' thus:—
"All ye mast-'342'ers '19' '165' '56' '299' me '145' '619's '39' a '691' whale. Look ye! d'ye '66' '14' Spanish ounce of g'261'?"—'956' up a b'937' b'40' coin to '4' sun—"it is a '578'teen dollar '747', '508'. D'ye '66' it? '197' Starbuck, h'6' me yon '739'-maul."
While '4' mate '28' '42'ting '4' hammer, Ahab, '327' '613'ing, '28' slowly rubbing '4' g'261' '747' '485' '4' skirts of '90' jacket, as if to heigh'606' '716' lustre, '6' '327' '970' '138' '429's '28' '80''313' lowly humming to '58''968', producing a '602' so st'868'gely muffled '6' inarticu'399' '7' it '562'ed '4' mechanical humming of '4' wheels of '90' vitality in '58'.
Receiving '4' '739'-maul '83' Starbuck, he advanced to'869'ds '4' main-mast '31' '4' hammer uplifted in '63' h'6', exhi'437'ing '4' g'261' '31' '4' '173', '6' '31' a '530' raised '915' exclaiming: "Whoso'167' of ye raises me a '691'-'342'ed whale '31' a wrinkled brow '6' a crooked jaw; '94'so'167' of ye raises me '7' '691'-'342'ed whale, '31' '291' holes punctu'796' in '90' starboard fluke—'73' ye, '94'so'167' of ye raises me '7' '276' '691' whale, he sh'34' '19' '14' g'261' ounce, my '311's!"
"Huzza! huzza!" cried '4' sea'508', as '31' s'768'ging tarpaulins '69' hailed '4' '735' of nailing '4' g'261' to '4' mast.
"It's a '691' whale, I '99'," resumed Ahab, as he threw d'249' '4' '739'maul: "a '691' whale. Skin y'119' '495' '17' '58', '508'; '73' sharp '17' '691' '604'; if ye '66' '33' a bubble, sing '44'."
All '14' '313' Tashtego, Daggoo, '6' Queequeg '97' '720' on '31' '140' '117' in'606'se inte'426' '6' '715' '169' '4' '426', '6' at '4' '508'tion of '4' wrinkled brow '6' crooked jaw '69' '97' '319'ed as if '356' '28' separately '678'ed by '96' specific recollection.
"Captain Ahab," '136' Tashtego, "'7' '691' whale '259' be '4' '276' '7' '96' c'34' Moby Dick."
"Moby Dick?" sh'44'ed Ahab. "Do ye k'56' '4' '691' whale '98', Tash?"
"Does he fan-tail a '105' curious, '284', '165' he '547' d'249'?" '136' '4' Gay-Header deliberately.
"And '129' he a curious sp'44', '111'," '136' Daggoo, "'131' bushy, '140' '17' a parmacetty, '6' '240'y quick, Captain Ahab?"
"And he '19' '63', '149', '291'—oh! '68' '128'y iron in '58' hide, '111', Captain," cried Queequeg disjointedly, "'34' twiske-tee be-twisk, '46' '58'—'58'—" falte'847' '321' '17' a '429', '6' scre'768'g '90' h'6' round '6' round as '463' uncorking a bottle—"'46' '58'—'58'—"
"Corkscrew!" cried Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, '4' harpoons '596' '34' twisted '6' wrenched in '58'; aye, Daggoo, '90' sp'44' is a '201' '63', '46' a '251' shock of wh'545', '6' '691' as a pile of '119' Nantucket wool '180' '4' '164' annual '50'ep-'50'a'847'; aye, Tashtego, '6' he fan-tails '46' a split jib in a squ'34'. D'545'h '6' d'779's! '508', it is Moby Dick ye '19' '333'—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!"
"Captain Ahab," '136' Starbuck, '94', '31' Stubb '6' Fl'257', '97' thus '458' '91' '784'ing '90' superior '31' increasing '715', '33' at '181' '562'ed struck '31' a '147' '265' '96''11' '656'ed '34' '4' '683'. "Captain Ahab, I '19' '299' of Moby Dick—'33' it '28' '23' Moby Dick '7' '111'k '141' thy leg?"
"Who '163' '4'e '7'?" cried Ahab; '98' pa'970', "Aye, Starbuck; aye, my '374'ies '34' round; it '28' Moby Dick '7' dismasted me; Moby Dick '7' '561' me to '14' '314' stump I st'6' on '56'. Aye, aye," he sh'44'ed '31' a terrific, loud, animal sob, '46' '7' of a '374'-stricken moose; "Aye, aye! it '28' '7' accursed '691' whale '7' razeed me; '721'e a '719' pegging lubber of me '17' '167' '6' a '183'!" Then tossing '312' arms, '31' mea'115''759' imprecations he sh'44'ed '44': "Aye, aye! '6' '82' c'129'e '58' round Good Hope, '6' round '4' Horn, '6' round '4' Nor'103' Maelstrom, '6' round perdition's flames '165' I '145' '58' up. And '14' is '11' ye '19' shipped '17', '508'! to c'129'e '7' '691' whale on '312' '500's of l'6', '6' '118' '34' '500's of '987', '773' he sp'44's '751' '593' '6' rolls fin '44'. What '99' ye, '508', '76' ye spl'972' '524' on it, '56'? I '54' ye do '73' brave."
"Aye, aye!" sh'44'ed '4' harpo'63'ers '6' sea'508', '573' '452'r to '4' excited '261' '128': "A sharp '784' '17' '4' '691' whale; a sharp lance '17' Moby Dick!"
"God b'759' ye," he '562'ed to '499' sob '6' '499' sh'44'. "God b'759' ye, '508'. Ste'869'd! go draw '4' '164' mea'115' of grog. But '11''s '14' '192' '352' '39', '197' Starbuck; wilt thou '23' c'129'e '4' '691' whale? art '23' '544' '17' Moby Dick?"
"I am '544' '17' '90' crooked jaw, '6' '17' '4' jaws of D'545'h '111', Captain Ahab, if it '807'ly '67's in '4' '103' of '4' '355' we '858'; '33' I '246' '43' to hunt whales, '23' my com'128'der's vengeance. How '128'y '960'rels '76' thy vengeance yield '4'e '140' if thou '42''704' it, Captain Ahab? it '76' '23' fetch '4'e '137' in '119' Nantucket market."
"Nantucket market! Hoot! But '67' '452'r, Starbuck; thou requi'426' a '105' l'969'r layer. If m'63'y's to be '4' mea'115'r, '128', '6' '4' ac'893'ants '19' com'186'ed '238' '164' '893'ing-ho'364' '4' globe, by girdling it '31' guineas, '63' to e'131' '291' '348's of an inch; '98', '123' me '81' '4'e, '7' my vengeance '76' fetch a '164' premium '43'!"
"He smites '90' chest," w'90'pe'796' Stubb, "'11''s '7' '17'? '559'hinks it '847's '344' vast, '33' hollow."
"Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "'7' simply smote '4'e '83' blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged '31' a dumb '124', Captain Ahab, '562's blasphemous."
"Hark ye '332' '158'—'4' '105' l'969'r layer. All visible objects, '128', '36' '33' as '536'eboard m'257's. But in '356' '140't—in '4' '565' '735', '4' undoubted deed—t'43', '96' un'677' '33' s'773' '385'ing '124' '186's '17'th '4' mouldings of '716' f'545'ures '83' '528' '4' un'385'ing m'257'. If '128' '76' strike, strike '209' '4' m'257'! How '51' '4' pris'63'r r'356' '44''500' '722' by thrusting '209' '4' w'34'? To me, '4' '691' whale is '7' w'34', shoved '958' to me. So'559'imes I '54' t'43''s naught beyond. But 'tis '243'. He t'257's me; he heaps me; I '66' in '58' '44'rageous strength, '31' an inscrut'473' mal'972' si'212'ing it. That inscrut'473' '124' is chiefly '11' I '413'; '6' be '4' '691' whale agent, or be '4' '691' whale principal, I '76' wreak '7' '413' upon '58'. Talk '23' to me of blasphemy, '128'; '190' strike '4' sun if it insulted me. For '87' '4' sun do '7', '98' '87' I do '4' '173'; '317' t'43' is '167' a '563' of '807' '412' '43'in, jealousy presiding '118' '34' cr'545'ions. But '23' my master, '128', is '140' '7' '807' '412'. Who's '118' me? Truth hath no con'178's. Take '141' thine '784'! '117' '155'ler'473' '169' fi'398's' gla'847's is a doltish st'36'! So, so; thou '796'denest '6' palest; my h'545' '129' melted '4'e to anger-glow. But '73' ye, Starbuck, '11' is '136' in h'545', '7' '124' un'415' '716'elf. T'43' '36' '508' '83' '94'm '869'm '429's '36' sm'34' indignity. I '588' '23' to incense '4'e. Let it go. Look! '66' yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—'565', brea'124' '648's '684'ted by '4' sun. The Pagan leopards—'4' unrecking '6' unworshipping '124's, '7' '349'; '6' '66'k, '6' '145' no '385's '17' '4' torrid '139' '69' '174'! The crew, '128', '4' crew! Are '69' '23' '63' '6' '34' '31' Ahab, in '14' '301' of '4' whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to '54' of it. St'6' up amid '4' general hurri'51'e, thy '63' tost sapling '51''23', Starbuck! And '11' is it? Reckon it. 'Tis '33' to '148' strike a fin; no wondrous f'545' '17' Starbuck. What is it '117'? From '14' '63' '719' hunt, '98', '4' '258' lance '44' of '34' Nantucket, '115'ly he '76' '23' '621' '78', '74' e'131' '17'emast-h'6' '129' clutched a whetst'63'? Ah! constrainings seize '4'e; I '66'! '4' '899'ow lifts '4'e! Speak, '33' '613'!—Aye, aye! thy silence, '98', '7' '915's '4'e. (A'500') So'559'hing s'576' '83' my di'399'd nostrils, he '129' inhaled it in '90' lungs. Starbuck '56' is '462'; '51''23' oppose me '56', '327' rebellion."
"God '184' me!—'184' us '34'!" murmu'796' Starbuck, lowly.
But in '90' joy at '4' enchanted, tacit acquiescence of '4' mate, Ahab '64' '23' '230' '90' '17'eboding invocation; nor '332' '4' low laugh '83' '4' '330'; nor '332' '4' presaging vibrations of '4' '768'ds in '4' cordage; nor '332' '4' hollow flap of '4' sails '485' '4' masts, as '17' a mo'508't '238' '374's sank in. For '158' Starbuck's d'249'cast '495' '703'ed up '31' '4' stubbornness of '139'; '4' subter'868'ean laugh '474'd '170'; '4' '768'ds blew on; '4' sails filled '44'; '4' ship heaved '6' rolled as '165'. Ah, ye admonitions '6' '869'nings! '65' '235' ye '23' '74' ye '67'? But '743' '36' ye p'796'ictions '169' '869'nings, ye s'97'ows! Yet '23' so '137' p'796'ictions '83' '327', as verifications of '4' '17'e'45' '124's '31'in. For '31' '105' external to constrain us, '4' inner'344' neces'421'ies in '119' '213', '182' s'773' '698' us on.
"The mea'115'! '4' mea'115'!" cried Ahab.
Receiving '4' brimming pewter, '6' '391'ing to '4' harpo'63'ers, he '619'ed '116' to produce '238' weapons. Then '868'ging '116' '165' '58' '958' '4' capstan, '31' '238' harpoons in '238' '524', '313' '90' '291' mates s'111'd at '90' '500' '31' '238' lances, '6' '4' '426' of '4' ship's '624' '17'med a circle round '4' group; he s'111'd '17' an instant searchingly '784'ing e'131' '128' of '90' crew. But '200' wild '495' '559' '90', as '4' '593's'576' '495' of '4' pr'769'ie wolves '381' '4' '784' of '238' leader, ere he ru'50's on at '238' '342' in '4' trail of '4' bi'273'; '33', alas! '146' to f'34' '155' '4' hidden sn'36' of '4' Indian.
"Drink '6' '962'!" he cried, h'6'ing '4' heavy charged fl'414'n to '4' '958'est sea'128'. "The crew al'63' '56' '580'. Round '31' it, round! Short draughts—'192' sw'34'ows, '508'; 'tis '576' as Satan's hoof. So, so; it '547' round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; '17'ks '44' at '4' serpent-snapping '784'. Well d'63'; al'344' drained. That '103' it '277', '14' '103' it '67's. H'6' it me—'43''s a hollow! Men, ye '562' '4' '266'; so brimming '139' is gulped '6' g'63'. Ste'869'd, refill!
"At'606'd '56', my braves. I '19' '259'e'796' ye '34' round '14' capstan; '6' ye mates, flank me '31' y'119' lances; '6' ye harpo'63'ers, st'6' t'43' '31' y'119' irons; '6' ye, st'44' mariners, '847' me in, '7' I '289' in '96' '563' revive a noble custom of my fi'50'r'128' '233's '165' me. O '508', '1' '76' '332' '66' '7'—Ha! '311', '67' '78'? '217' pennies '67' '23' '358'er. H'6' it me. Why, '56', '14' pewter '97' '366' brimming '158', '85''t '23' thou St. Vitus' imp—'170', thou ague!
"Advance, ye mates! Cross y'119' lances '597' '165' me. Well d'63'! Let me '678' '4' axis." So '99'ing, '31' ex'606'ded arm, he grasped '4' '291' level, radiating lances at '238' crossed centre; '313' so '143', suddenly '6' nervously twitched '116'; '80''313', glancing in'606'tly '83' Starbuck to Stubb; '83' Stubb to Fl'257'. It '562'ed as '463', by '96' '275''759', interior volition, he '72' fain '19' shocked '155' '116' '4' '276' fiery emotion accumu'399'd '31'in '4' Leyden jar of '90' '249' magnetic '139'. The '291' mates quailed '165' '90' '777', sustained, '6' mystic aspect. Stubb '6' Fl'257' '720' '500''103's '83' '58'; '4' h'913't '784' of Starbuck '947' d'249''40'.
"In vain!" cried Ahab; "'33', '126', 'tis '35'. For '64' ye '291' '33' '336' '101' '4' '597'-'17'ced shock, '98' '462' '249' electric '124', '7' '97' '760' expi'796' '83' '44' me. Per'365', '111', it '72' '19' '705'ped ye '314'. Per'365' ye '107' it '23'. D'249' lances! And '56', ye mates, I do ap'378' ye '291' cupbe'36'rs to my '291' pagan kins'508' t'43'—yon '291' '344' hon'119''473' gentle'508' '6' noble'508', my valiant harpo'63'ers. Disdain '4' t'257'? What, '74' '4' '164' Pope wa'50's '4' '908' of beggars, '970' '90' tiara '17' ewer? Oh, my '584' '324'dinals! y'119' '249' condescension, '7' sh'34' b'398' ye to it. I do '23' '619' ye; ye '76' it. Cut y'119' seizings '6' draw '4' poles, ye harpo'63'ers!"
Silently obeying '4' '619', '4' '291' harpo'63'ers '56' s'111'd '31' '4' detached iron '348' of '238' harpoons, '96' '291' '908' '192', held, '960'bs up, '165' '58'.
"Stab me '23' '31' '7' keen steel! Cant '116'; '51't '116' '118'! k'56' ye '23' '4' gob'123' '398'? Turn up '4' socket! So, so; '56', ye cup-be'36'rs, advance. The irons! '101' '116'; '330' '116' '313' I fill!" Forth'31', slowly '45' '83' '63' '493'r to '4' '173', he brimmed '4' harpoon sockets '31' '4' fiery '604's '83' '4' pewter.
"Now, '291' to '291', ye st'6'. Com'508'd '4' '776'ous chal'972's! Bestow '116', ye '94' '36' '56' '721'e '348'ies to '14' indissoluble league. Ha! Starbuck! '33' '4' deed is d'63'! Yon ratifying sun '56' '154's to '421' upon it. Drink, ye harpo'63'ers! '580' '6' '746', ye '508' '7' '128' '4' '548'ful whaleboat's bow—D'545'h to Moby Dick! God hunt us '34', if we do '23' hunt Moby Dick to '90' '548'!" The '192', '960''515' steel gob'123's '85' lifted; '6' to cries '6' maledictions '485' '4' '691' whale, '4' spir'716' '85' simultaneously quaffed d'249' '31' a '90's. Starbuck paled, '6' '391'ed, '6' shive'796'. Once '117', '6' fin'34'y, '4' repleni'50'd pewter '277' '4' rounds among '4' f'868'tic crew; '74', waving '90' '523' h'6' to '116', '69' '34' dispersed; '6' Ahab re'789' '31'in '90' cabin.




CHAPTER 37. Sun'451'.

The cabin; by '4' stern '768'dows; Ahab '812' al'63', '6' gazing '44'.
I '224' a '691' '6' turbid '830'; pale '604's, paler cheeks, w'43''er I sail. The envious '899'ows '500''192' s'35' to whelm my track; '123' '116'; '33' '171' I '962'.
Yonder, by '167'-brimming gob'123''s rim, '4' '869'm waves blush '46' '768'e. The g'261' brow plumbs '4' blue. The diver sun—slow dived '83' noon—'547' d'249'; my soul mounts up! '50' '854'ies '31' '49' '398''759' hill. Is, '98', '4' cr'249' '111' heavy '7' I '854'? '14' Iron Cr'249' of Lom'960'dy. Yet is it b'40' '31' '128'y a gem; I '4' we'36'r, '66' '23' '716' '458' flashings; '33' '967'ly '174' '7' I '854' '7', '7' dazzlingly con'295's. 'Tis iron—'7' I k'56'—'23' g'261'. 'Tis split, '111'—'7' I '174'; '4' jagged edge g'34's me so, my brain '562's to '942' '485' '4' solid '559'al; aye, steel skull, '462'; '4' '563' '7' '460' no hel'559' in '4' '344' brain-batte'847' '535'!
Dry h'545' upon my brow? Oh! '75' '28', '74' as '4' sunrise nobly spur'796' me, so '4' sun'451' soo'4'd. No '117'. T'90' '112'ly '703', it '703's '23' me; '34' '112''518'ss is anguish to me, '317' I '51' ne'er '932'. Gifted '31' '4' '530' perception, I lack '4' low, '932'ing '637'; '386'ed, '344' subtly '6' '344' malignantly! '386'ed in '4' midst of Paradise! Good '168'—'68' '168'! (waving '90' h'6', he '367's '83' '4' '768'dow.)
'T'28' '23' so '321' a t'257'. I '147' to '156' '63' stubborn, at '4' '402'; '33' my '63' cogged circle f'716' '155' '34' '238' various wheels, '6' '69' revolve. Or, if '1' '76', '46' so '128'y ant-hills of powder, '69' '34' st'6' '165' me; '6' I '238' match. Oh, '321'! '7' to '522' '173's, '4' match '716'elf '259' '460' be '28'ting! What '114' da'796', '114' '76'ed; '6' '11' '114' '76'ed, '82' do! T'84' '54' me '721'—Starbuck '185'; '33' '16' demoniac, I am '721'ness '721'dened! That wild '721'ness '55' '146' '804' to compreh'398' '716'elf! The prophecy '28' '7' I '134' be dismembe'796'; '6'—Aye! I '387' '14' leg. I '56' prophesy '7' I '76' dismember my dismemberer. Now, '98', be '4' prophet '6' '4' fulfiller '63'. That's '117' '169' ye, ye '164' '152's, '167' '85'. I laugh '6' hoot at ye, ye cricket-'412'ers, ye pugi'919's, ye deaf Burkes '6' blinded '742'di'547'! I '76' '23' '99' as '351''311's do to bul'596's—Take '96' '63' of y'119' '249' size; '21' pommel me! No, ye've knocked me d'249', '6' I am up '158'; '33' ye '19' '366' '6' hidden. Come '17'th '83' '528' y'119' cotton bags! I '19' no '192' '723' to r'356' ye. Come, Ahab's compli'508'ts to ye; '67' '6' '66' if ye '51' swerve me. Swerve me? ye '51''23' swerve me, '234' ye swerve y'119'selves! '128' '129' ye t'43'. Swerve me? The path to my '950'ed purpose is laid '31' iron rails, w'43'on my soul is grooved to '366'. Over un'602'ed gorges, '209' '4' rifled '374's of mountains, '447' torrents' '515's, uner'847'ly I rush! Naught's an obstacle, naught's an angle to '4' iron '103'!




CHAPTER 38. Dusk.

By '4' mainmast; Starbuck leaning '485' it.
My soul is '117' '169' matched; s'86' '118''128'ned; '6' by a '721''128'! Insuffer'473' sting, '7' sanity '134' ground arms on '375' a field! But he drilled deep d'249', '6' b'181'ed '34' my '385' '44' of me! I '54' I '66' '90' impious '398'; '33' '174' '7' I '259' '148' '58' to it. Will I, nill I, '4' ineff'473' '124' '129' tied me to '58'; tows me '31' a c'473' I '19' no knife to '537'. Horrible '261' '128'! Who's '118' '58', he cries;—aye, he '72' be a democrat to '34' above; '73', '60' he lords it '118' '34' below! Oh! I plainly '66' my miser'473' '493',—to obey, rebelling; '6' '623' '332', to '413' '31' '678' of pity! For in '90' '495' I '504' '96' lurid woe '72' shrivel me up, '97' I it. Yet is t'43' '274'. Time '6' tide flow wide. The '413'd whale '129' '4' round '604'y '296' to swim in, as '4' sm'34' g'261'-fish '129' '716' gl'652'y globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God '289' wedge a'500'. I '72' up '374', '85' it '23' '46' lead. But my '251' clock's '366' d'249'; my '374' '4' '34'-'632'ling w'879', I '19' no key to lift '158'.
[A burst of revelry '83' '4' '17'ecastle.]
Oh, God! to sail '31' '375' a hea'98' crew '7' '19' sm'34' '678' of hu'128' m'173's in '116'! W'148'ed '96'w'43' by '4' sharkish sea. The '691' whale is '238' demigorgon. Hark! '4' infernal orgies! '7' revelry is '17''869'd! mark '4' unfalte'847' silence aft! Me'54's it '648's '139'. Fore'344' '209' '4' sparkling sea '855's on '4' gay, embattled, bante'847' bow, '33' '146' to drag '967' Ahab '180' it, w'43' he broods '31'in '90' stern'869'd cabin, builded '118' '4' '314' '604' of '4' '830', '6' fur'4'r on, hunted by '716' wolfish gurglings. The '192' '60'l thrills me '209'! Peace! ye revellers, '6' '451' '4' '430'! Oh, '139'! 'tis in an '612' '46' '14', '31' soul '942' d'249' '6' held to k'56'ledge,—as wild, untuto'796' '124's '36' '17'ced to feed—Oh, '139'! 'tis '56' '7' I do '174' '4' la'606't horror in '4'e! '33' 'tis '23' me! '7' horror's '44' of me! '6' '31' '4' soft '174'ing of '4' hu'128' in me, '332' '76' I '244' to '535' ye, ye grim, phantom '670's! St'6' by me, '330' me, bind me, O ye b'759'ed influences!

Fore-Top.

(Stubb solus, '6' '508'ding a brace.)
Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! '574' my throat!—'114' '91' '54'ing '118' it '167' '317', '6' '7' ha, ha's '4' final consequence. Why so? Beca'364' a laugh's '4' wisest, easiest '491' to '34' '55' queer; '6' '67' '11' '76', '63' com'17't's '194' '269'—'7' unfailing com'17't is, '30' '34' p'796'estinated. I '299' '23' '34' '90' '150' '31' Starbuck; '33' to my '719' '784' Starbuck '98' '720' so'559'hing as I '4' '173' '140'ing '577'. Be '115' '4' '261' Mogul '129' '950'ed '58', '111'. I twigged it, k'212' it; '97' '97' '4' '964', '240' '504'ily '19' prophesied it—'17' '74' I clapped my '784' upon '90' skull I '282' it. Well, Stubb, wise Stubb—'55' my title—'35', Stubb, '11' of it, Stubb? Here's a '324''390'. I k'56' '23' '34' '7' '289' be '260', '33' be it '11' it '76', '82' go to it laughing. Such a waggish lee'847' as lurks in '34' y'119' horribles! I '174' '427'ny. Fa, la! lirra, skirra! What's my juicy '105' pear at '179' '143' '56'? Crying '716' '495' '44'?—Giving a '348'y to '4' '181' arrived harpo'63'ers, I d'36' '99', gay as a frigate's pennant, '6' so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh—
We'll '580' to-'168' '31' '374's as '703', To '112', as gay '6' fleeting As bubbles '7' swim, on '4' beaker's brim, And '448' on '4' lips '313' '381'ing.
A brave stave '7'—'94' c'34's? '197' Starbuck? Aye, aye, '284'—(A'500') '86' my superior, he '129' '90' '111', if '16' '23' mis'645'.—Aye, aye, '284', '22' '209' '31' '14' '292'—'260'.

(Foresail rises '6' disc'118's '4' '430' st'6'ing, lounging, leaning, '6' '666' in various attitudes, '34' singing in chorus.)
     F'36''35' '6' a'474'u to '1', Spanish la'474's!

For as '4' '669's of '4' currents in '4' seas '19' n'167' '332' '91' divulged, '140' to '4' '344' erudite research; so '4' hidden '103's of '4' Sperm Whale '74' ben'545'h '4' sur'352' remain, in '164' '348', unac'893''473' to '90' pursuers; '6' '83' '75' to '75' '19' originated '4' '344' curious '6' contradictory speculations regarding '116', especi'34'y c'336'rning '4' mystic modes w'43'by, '180' '602'ing to a '164' depth, he t'868'sports '58''968' '31' '375' vast swiftness to '4' '344' widely distant '378's.
It is a '124' '35' '677' to '312' Ameri'51' '6' English whale-ships, '6' as '35' a '124' '226'd upon authoritative record '266' '414' by Scoresby, '7' '96' whales '19' '91' captu'796' '458' north in '4' Pacific, in '94'se bo'474's '19' '91' '295' '4' '960'bs of harpoons darted in '4' Greenl'6' seas.

Hence, by inference, it '129' '91' '172'd by '96' whale'508', '7' '4' Nor' West P'652'age, so '192' a '293' to '128', '28' n'167' a '293' to '4' whale.

Forced '155' familiarity, '98', '31' '375' prodigies as '182'; '6' kno'768'g '7' '180' rep'545'ed, intrepid '652'aults, '4' W'479'e Whale '97' escaped a'349'; it '51''23' be '137' '301' of '715' '7' '96' whale'508' '134' go s'773' fur'4'r in '238' superstitions; decla'847' Moby Dick '23' '146' ubiquitous, '33' immortal ('17' immortality is '33' ubiquity in '75'); '7' '463' groves of spears '134' be '519'ted in '90' flanks, he '72' s'773' swim '170' unharmed; or if indeed he '134' '167' be '721'e to sp'44' thick '593', '375' a sight '72' be '33' a g'129'tly deception; '17' '158' in unensanguined '899'ows hund'796's of leagues '170', '90' unsul'596'd jet '72' '336' '117' be '333'.
But '140' s'798'ped of '182' supernatural surmisings, t'43' '28' '243' in '4' '987'ly '106' '6' incon'704''473' char'735'er of '4' monster to strike '4' imagination '31' unwonted '637'. For, it '28' '23' so '137' '90' uncommon bulk '7' so '137' distingui'50'd '58' '83' '173' sperm whales, '33', as '28' '234'w'43' '687'n '44'—a peculiar s'56'-'691' wrinkled '17'e'342', '6' a '530', pyramidical '691' hump. These '85' '90' pro'462'nt f'545'ures; '4' tokens w'43'by, '140' in '4' limit'759', uncharted seas, he revealed '90' identity, at a '192' distance, to '200' '94' k'212' '58'.
The '426' of '90' '618' '28' so streaked, '6' spotted, '6' marbled '31' '4' '276' shrouded hue, '7', in '4' '398', he '97' gained '90' distinctive appellation of '4' W'479'e Whale; a '275', indeed, liter'34'y '22'ified by '90' vivid aspect, '74' '333' gliding at '530' noon '209' a '967' blue sea, '568' a milky-'103' '830' of creamy foam, '34' spangled '31' g'261'en gleamings.
Nor '28' it '90' unwonted magnitude, nor '90' remark'473' hue, nor '332' '90' de'17'med l'969'r jaw, '7' so '137' invested '4' whale '31' natural terror, as '7' unexampled, in'81'igent malignity '265', according to specific ac'893's, he '97' '118' '6' '118' '158' evinced in '90' '652'aults. More '169' '34', '90' tr'356'erous retr'545's struck '117' of dis'289' '169' '760' aught '234'. For, '74' swimming '165' '90' exulting pursuers, '31' e'131' app'36'nt symptom of alarm, he '97' s'167'al '464' '91' '677' to '391' round suddenly, '6', bea'847' d'249' upon '116', ei'4'r stave '238' boats to splinters, or '698' '116' '78' in consternation to '238' ship.
Al'325' s'167'al fatalities '97' at'606'ded '90' c'129'e. But '463' similar disasters, '60''167' '105' bruited ashore, '85' by no '410' unusual in '4' fi'50'ry; '332', in '344' instances, '375' '562'ed '4' W'479'e Whale's infernal a'17'e'147' of fero'709', '7' e'131' dismembe'847' or '548' '7' he ca'364'd, '28' '23' '94'lly regarded as '305' '91' inflicted by an unin'81'igent agent.
Judge, '98', to '11' pitches of inflamed, distr'735'ed fury '4' '241's of '90' '117' desperate hunters '85' impelled, '74' amid '4' chips of chewed boats, '6' '4' sinking limbs of torn comrades, '69' swam '44' of '4' '691' curds of '4' whale's direful wrath '155' '4' serene, exasperating sun'703', '7' smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
His '291' boats stove '187' '58', '6' oars '6' '508' '312' whirling in '4' ed'474's; '63' captain, seizing '4' '518'-knife '83' '90' '785'n prow, '97' da'50'd at '4' whale, as an Arkansas duel'919' at '90' foe, blindly '66'king '31' a '578' inch blade to r'356' '4' fathom-deep '139' of '4' whale. That captain '28' Ahab. And '98' it '28', '7' suddenly sweeping '90' '541'le-shaped l'969'r jaw ben'545'h '58', Moby Dick '97' reaped '170' Ahab's leg, as a m'969'r a blade of gr'652' in '4' field. No turbaned Turk, no hi'796' Venetian or Malay, '87' '19' smote '58' '31' '117' '562'ing mal'972'. Sm'34' '385' '28' t'43' to doubt, '98', '7' '167' '317' '7' al'344' fatal en'893'er, Ahab '97' c'49'i'50'd a wild vindictiveness '485' '4' whale, '34' '4' '117' '947' '17' '7' in '90' f'868'tic morbidness he at '181' '246' to identify '31' '58', '23' '146' '34' '90' bodily woes, '33' '34' '90' in'81'ectual '6' spiritual exasperations. The W'479'e Whale swam '165' '58' as '4' mono'128'iac in'324'nation of '34' '200' malicious agencies '265' '96' deep '508' '174' '545'ing in '116', '773' '69' '36' '269' '565' on '31' '499' a '374' '6' '499' a lung. That intangible malignity '265' '129' '91' '83' '4' beginning; to '94'se dominion '140' '4' modern '917'tians ascribe '63'-'499' of '4' '296's; '265' '4' ancient Op'479'es of '4' east r'167'enced in '238' statue d'779';—Ahab '64' '23' f'34' d'249' '6' worship it '46' '116'; '33' deliriously t'868'sfer'847' '716' '256' to '4' abhor'796' '691' whale, he pitted '58''968', '34' muti'399'd, '485' it.

He piled upon '4' whale's '691' hump '4' sum of '34' '4' general rage '6' '413' '577' by '90' '251' race '83' Adam d'249'; '6' '98', as if '90' chest '97' '91' a mortar, he burst '90' '576' '374''s s'245' upon it.
It is '23' prob'473' '7' '14' mono'128'ia in '58' '111'k '716' instant rise at '4' precise '75' of '90' bodily dismember'508't. Then, in darting at '4' monster, knife in h'6', he '97' '33' '145'n loose to a sudden, '962'ionate, corporal animo'421'y; '6' '74' he received '4' stroke '7' tore '58', he '307' '33' '577' '4' '414'nizing bodily laceration, '33' no'124' '117'. Yet, '74' by '14' collision '17'ced to '391' to'869'ds '179', '6' '17' '192' '611' of '433' '6' '731', Ahab '6' anguish lay stretched to'42''49' in '63' hammock, rounding in mid '768'ter '7' dreary, '60'ling Pat'414'nian Cape; '98' it '28', '7' '90' torn '618' '6' ga'50'd soul bled '155' '63' an'173'; '6' so interf'970', '721'e '58' '721'. That it '28' '146' '98', on '4' '179''869'd voyage, '180' '4' en'893'er, '7' '4' final mono'128'ia seized '58', '562's '34' '33' '979' '83' '4' '418' '7', at intervals du'847' '4' '962'age, he '28' a raving lunatic; '6', '463' unlim'515' of a leg, '332' '375' vital strength '332' lurked in '90' Egyptian chest, '6' '28' '117''118' in'606'sified by '90' delirium, '7' '90' mates '85' '17'ced to lace '58' '692', '140' t'43', as he sailed, raving in '90' hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to '4' '721' rockings of '4' gales. And, '74' '573' '155' '117' suffer'473' latitudes, '4' ship, '31' mild stun'sails sp'504', floated across '4' t'868'quil tropics, '6', to '34' appea'868'ces, '4' '261' '128''s delirium '562'ed '269' '528' '58' '31' '4' Cape Horn s'35's, '6' he '246' '17'th '83' '90' '967' den '155' '4' b'759'ed '703' '6' '769'; '140' '98', '74' he bore '7' firm, collected '569', '60''167' pale, '6' issued '90' '804' '619's '336' '158'; '6' '90' mates '144'ed God '4' direful '721'ness '28' '56' g'63'; '140' '98', Ahab, in '90' hidden '968', raved on. Hu'128' '721'ness is of'606''464' a cunning '6' '344' fe'518' '124'. When '1' '54' it fled, it '289' '19' '33' be'67' t'868's'575'd '155' '96' s'773' subtler '17'm. Ahab's '597' lunacy sub'500'd '23', '33' deepeningly contr'735'ed; '46' '4' unabated Hud'273', '74' '7' noble North'128' flows narrowly, '33' unfathomably '209' '4' Highl'6' gorge. But, as in '90' narrow-flo'768'g mono'128'ia, '23' '63' jot of Ahab's b'937' '721'ness '97' '91' '269' '528'; so in '7' b'937' '721'ness, '23' '63' jot of '90' '164' natural in'81'ect '97' peri'50'd. That '165' '565' agent, '56' be'246' '4' '565' instru'508't. If '375' a furious trope '289' st'6', '90' '591' lunacy stormed '90' general sanity, '6' '324'ried it, '6' '391'ed '34' '716' c'336'nt'796' '51'non upon '716' '249' '721' mark; so '7' '458' '83' '305' '387' '90' strength, Ahab, to '7' '63' '398', '64' '56' possess a thous'6' f'261' '117' po'606'cy '169' '167' he '97' sanely '561' to bear upon '138' '63' '385''473' object.
T'90' is '137'; '332' Ahab's larger, '967'er, deeper '348' remains unhinted. But vain to popularize pro'427'dities, '6' '34' '350' is pro'295'. Winding '458' d'249' '83' '31'in '4' '131' '374' of '14' spiked Hotel de Cluny w'43' we '43' st'6'—'60''167' gr'6' '6' '533', '56' quit it;—'6' '101' y'119' '103', ye nobler, sadder souls, to '200' vast Ro'128' h'34's of T'49'mes; w'43' '458' ben'545'h '4' fantastic t'969'rs of '128''s upper '987', '90' root of gr'6'eur, '90' '251' awful essence '421's in bearded '892'; an antique buried ben'545'h antiquities, '6' thr'63'd on torsoes! So '31' a '785'n thr'63', '4' '164' '152's mock '7' captive king; so '46' a Caryatid, he patient '421's, up'956' on '90' frozen brow '4' piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye d'249' t'43', ye '896'er, sadder souls! '455' '7' '896', sad king!

Now, in '90' '374', Ahab '97' '96' glimpse of '14', '275'ly: '34' my '410' '36' sane, my motive '6' my object '721'. Yet '327' '637' to '320', or '397', or shun '4' '418'; he '46'wise k'212' '7' to '128''207' he '64' '192' dissemble; in '96' '563', '64' s'773'. But '7' '124' of '90' dissembling '28' '146' subject to '90' perceptibility, '23' to '90' '76' determinate. N'167''4''759', so '35' '64' he succeed in '7' dissembling, '7' '74' '31' ivory leg he '761'ped ashore at '181', no Nantucketer '147' '58' '173'wise '169' '33' natur'34'y grieved, '6' '7' to '4' quick, '31' '4' '816' casualty '265' '97' '118''645' '58'.
The report of '90' undeni'473' delirium at sea '28' '46'wise popularly ascri'515' to a '207''796' ca'364'. And so '111', '34' '4' added moodiness '265' '194' '180''869'ds, to '4' '131' '183' of sailing in '4' Pequod on '4' '986' voyage, sat brooding on '90' brow. Nor is it so '131' un'46'ly, '7' '458' '83' dis'395'ing '90' fitness '17' an'173' whaling voyage, on ac'893' of '375' '967' symptoms, '4' calculating '151' of '7' prudent isle '85' inc'518'd to harbor '4' c'336'it, '7' '17' '200' '131' '385's he '28' '34' '4' '166' qualified '6' '451' on edge, '17' a pursuit so '597' of rage '6' wildness as '4' '593'y hunt of whales.

Had '138' '63' of '90' '261' acquaintances on shore '33' '499' '710'ed of '11' '28' lurking in '58' '98', '60' '358' '72' '238' ag'129't '6' '40'eous souls '19' wrenched '4' ship '83' '375' a fi'398'ish '128'!

Here, '98', '28' '14' grey-'342'ed, un'152'ly '261' '128', c'129'ing '31' curses a Job's whale round '4' '296', at '4' '342' of a crew, '111', chiefly '721'e up of mongrel renegades, '6' cast'170's, '6' '51'nibals—mor'34'y enfeebled '516', by '4' incompe'606'ce of mere unaided virtue or '40'-'241'edness in Starbuck, '4' invuner'473' jollity of indifference '6' reck'759'ness in Stubb, '6' '4' pervading mediocrity in Fl'257'.

What '4' '691' whale '28' to Ahab, '129' '91' hinted; '11', at '464', he '28' to me, as '332' remains un'136'.
A'500' '83' '200' '117' obvious con'500'rations '678'ing Moby Dick, '265' '87' '23' '33' occasion'34'y a'830'n in '138' '128''s soul '96' alarm, t'43' '28' an'173' '147', or '743' vague, '275''759' horror c'336'rning '58', '265' at '464' by '716' in'606''421'y comp'123'ely '118'p'969''796' '34' '4' '426'; '6' '332' so mystical '6' '35' nigh ineff'473' '28' it, '7' I al'344' desp'769' of '966' it in a comprehensible '17'm. It '28' '4' whi'606'ess of '4' whale '7' above '34' '124's app'34'ed me. But '60' '51' I '274' to '656' '302' '43'; '6' '332', in '96' dim, r'6'om '103', '656' '302' I '259', '234' '34' '182' chapters '240' be naught.
Though in '128'y natural objects, whi'606'ess refiningly enhances beauty, as if im'348'ing '96' '591' virtue of '716' '249', as in marbles, japonicas, '6' pearls; '6' '463' various nations '19' in '96' '103' recognised a '979' royal pree'462'nce in '14' hue; '140' '4' '960''960'ic, gr'6' '261' kings of Pegu placing '4' title "Lord of '4' W'479'e Elephants" above '34' '238' '173' magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; '6' '4' modern kings of Siam unfurling '4' '276' s'56'-'691' quadruped in '4' royal st'6'ard; '6' '4' Han'118'ian flag bea'847' '4' '63' '575' of a s'56'-'691' charger; '6' '4' '164' Austrian Empire, Caesarian, heir to '118'lording Rome, '305' '17' '4' imperial col'119' '4' '276' imperial hue; '6' '463' '14' pre-e'462'nce in it app'596's to '4' hu'128' race '716'elf, '631' '4' '691' '128' '256'l mastership '118' e'131' dusky tribe; '6' '463', be'500's, '34' '14', whi'606'ess '129' '91' '140' '721'e '659'ifi'51't of '431'ness, '17' among '4' Ro'128's a '691' st'63' marked a joyful '183'; '6' '463' in '173' mortal sympathies '6' symbolizings, '14' '276' hue is '721'e '4' emblem of '128'y '678'ing, noble '124's—'4' innocence of b'852's, '4' benignity of age; '463' among '4' Red Men of America '4' '631' of '4' '691' belt of wampum '28' '4' deepest pledge of hon'119'; '463' in '128'y climes, whi'606'ess typifies '4' majesty of Just'972' in '4' er'462' of '4' Judge, '6' contri'33'es to '4' daily '892' of kings '6' queens drawn by milk-'691' steeds; '463' '140' in '4' '530'er mysteries of '4' '344' august religions it '129' '91' '721'e '4' symbol of '4' divine spot'759'ness '6' '637'; by '4' Persian '522' worshippers, '4' '691' '17'ked flame '213' held '4' ho'596'st on '4' altar; '6' in '4' Greek mythologies, Gr'545' Jove '58''968' '213' '721'e in'324'nate in a s'56'-'691' bull; '6' '463' to '4' noble Iroquois, '4' mid'768'ter sacrif'972' of '4' sac'796' W'479'e Dog '28' by '458' '4' ho'596'st festival of '238' '4'ology, '7' spot'759', faithful cr'545'ure '213' held '4' pu'426' envoy '69' '87' '642' to '4' Gr'545' Spirit '31' '4' annual tidings of '238' '249' fidelity; '6' '463' directly '83' '4' Latin '429' '17' '691', '34' '917'tian priests derive '4' '275' of '63' '348' of '238' sac'796' vesture, '4' alb or tunic, worn ben'545'h '4' c'652'ock; '6' '463' among '4' holy pomps of '4' Romish faith, '691' is speci'34'y employed in '4' celebration of '4' P'652'ion of '119' Lord; '463' in '4' Vision of St. '608', '691' robes '36' '145'n to '4' '796'eemed, '6' '4' '492'-'6'-t'277'y elders st'6' c'202'hed in '691' '165' '4' '164'-'691' thr'63', '6' '4' Holy One '7' '421'teth t'43' '691' '46' wool; '332' '17' '34' '182' accumu'399'd '652'ociations, '31' w'413'ver is '584', '6' hon'119''473', '6' sublime, t'43' '332' lurks an elusive so'559'hing in '4' inner'344' '256' of '14' hue, '265' strikes '117' of panic to '4' soul '169' '7' '796'ness '265' aff'40's in '593'.
T'90' elusive quality it is, '265' ca'364's '4' '147' of whi'606'ess, '74' divorced '83' '117' '207'ly '652'ociations, '6' '438'd '31' '138' object '816' in '716'elf, to heigh'606' '7' terror to '4' fur'4'st bounds. Witness '4' '691' bear of '4' poles, '6' '4' '691' shark of '4' tropics; '11' '33' '238' smooth, flaky whi'606'ess '408' '116' '4' t'868'sc'398'ent horrors '69' '36'? That g'129'tly whi'606'ess it is '265' im'348's '375' an abhorrent mildness, '140' '117' loath'96' '169' terrific, to '4' dumb gloating of '238' aspect. So '7' '23' '4' fierce-fanged tiger in '90' '49'aldic coat '51' so stagger c'119'age as '4' '691'-shrouded bear or shark.*
*With reference to '4' Polar bear, it '289' '999' be urged by '58' '94' '72' fain go s'773' deeper '155' '14' '301', '7' it is '23' '4' whi'606'ess, separately regarded, '265' heigh'606's '4' '155'ler'473' hideousness of '7' brute; '17', analysed, '7' heigh'606'ed hideousness, it '240' be '136', '146' rises '83' '4' circumstance, '7' '4' irresponsible ferociousness of '4' cr'545'ure st'6's invested in '4' fleece of celestial innocence '6' '112'; '6' hence, by b'847'ing to'42''49' '149' '375' oppo'421'e emotions in '119' '241's, '4' Polar bear frigh'606's us '31' so unnatural a contrast. But '140' '652'uming '34' '14' to be '354'; '332', '85' it '23' '17' '4' whi'606'ess, '1' '72' '23' '19' '7' in'606'sified terror.
As '17' '4' '691' shark, '4' '691' gliding ghost'518'ss of repose in '7' cr'545'ure, '74' beheld in '90' ordinary moods, st'868'gely t'34'ies '31' '4' '276' quality in '4' Polar quadruped. T'90' peculiarity is '344' vividly '479' by '4' French in '4' '275' '69' '258'ow upon '7' fish. The Romish m'652' '17' '4' '314' begins '31' "Requiem eternam" (eternal '426'), '74'ce Requiem denominating '4' m'652' '716'elf, '6' '138' '173' '427'eral '886'. Now, in '34'usion to '4' '691', silent s'773'ness of '548' in '14' shark, '6' '4' mild '314''518'ss of '90' hab'716', '4' French c'34' '58' Requin.
Be'54' '4'e of '4' albatross, '74'ce '67' '200' clouds of spiritual '683''508't '6' pale d'504', in '265' '7' '691' phantom sails in '34' imaginations? Not Cole'885' '171' threw '7' spell; '33' God's '164', unflatte'847' laur'545'e, Nature.*
*I '219' '4' '171' albatross I '167' '282'. It '28' du'847' a pro'192'ed gale, in '604's '321' upon '4' Antarctic seas. From my '17'enoon '430' below, I asc'398'ed to '4' '118'clouded deck; '6' t'43', da'50'd upon '4' main hatches, I '282' a regal, fea'4'ry '124' of unspotted whi'606'ess, '6' '31' a hooked, Ro'128' '899' sublime. At intervals, it arched '17'th '716' vast ar'397'l '768'gs, as if to embrace '96' holy ark. Wondrous flutte'847's '6' throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it utte'796' cries, as '96' king's ghost in supernatural distress. Through '716' inexpressible, st'868'ge '495', '559'hought I peeped to '669's '265' '111'k '330' of God. As Abraham '165' '4' angels, I b'969'd '302'; '4' '691' '124' '28' so '691', '716' '768'gs so wide, '6' in '200' '17' '167' exiled '604's, I '97' '387' '4' miser'473' '869'ping memories of traditions '6' of t'249's. Long I gazed at '7' prodigy of plumage. I '51''23' '81', '51' '146' hint, '4' '124's '7' darted '209' me '98'. But at '181' I awoke; '6' '391'ing, '257'ed a sailor '11' bird '28' '14'. A g'63'y, he rep'596'd. G'63'y! n'167' '97' '299' '7' '275' '165'; is it c'336'iv'473' '7' '14' glorious '124' is utterly un'677' to '508' ashore! n'167'! But '96' '75' '180', I '819'ed '7' g'63'y '28' '96' sea'128''s '275' '17' albatross. So '7' by no possibility '87' Cole'885''s wild Rhyme '19' '97' aught to do '31' '200' mystical impressions '265' '85' '462', '74' I '282' '7' bird upon '119' deck. For '948' '97' I '98' '504' '4' Rhyme, nor k'212' '4' bird to be an albatross. Yet, in '99'ing '14', I do '33' indirectly burnish a '105' b'40'er '4' noble merit of '4' poem '6' '4' poet.
I '652'ert, '98', '7' in '4' wondrous bodily whi'606'ess of '4' bird chiefly lurks '4' '669' of '4' spell; a '350' '4' '117' evinced in '14', '7' by a solecism of terms t'43' '36' birds c'34'ed grey albatrosses; '6' '182' I '19' frequently '333', '33' n'167' '31' '375' emotions as '74' I beheld '4' Antarctic fowl.
But '60' '97' '4' mystic '124' '91' '808'? W'90'per it '23', '6' I '76' '81'; '31' a tr'356'erous hook '6' '518', as '4' fowl floated on '4' sea. At '181' '4' Captain '721'e a post'128' of it; tying a '123'te'796', lea'4'rn t'34'y round '716' neck, '31' '4' ship's '75' '6' '226'; '6' '98' '123'ting it escape. But I doubt '23', '7' lea'4'rn t'34'y, '588' '17' '128', '28' '645' '141' in Heaven, '74' '4' '691' fowl flew to join '4' '768'g-f'261'ing, '4' invoking, '6' ado'847' c'49'ubim!
Most famous in '119' Western annals '6' Indian traditions is '7' of '4' W'479'e Steed of '4' Pr'769'ies; a magnif'972'nt milk-'691' charger, large-'784'd, sm'34'-'342'ed, bluff-chested, '6' '31' '4' dignity of a thous'6' monarchs in '90' lofty, '118'scorning '324'riage. He '28' '4' elected Xerxes of vast '49'ds of wild horses, '94'se '536'ures in '200' '433' '85' '146' fenced by '4' Rocky Mountains '6' '4' Alleghanies. At '238' flaming '342' he west'869'd trooped it '46' '7' chosen star '265' e'131' '140'ing leads on '4' hosts of '703'. The flashing cascade of '90' '128'e, '4' curving co'559' of '90' tail, invested '58' '31' ho'970's '117' respl'398'ent '169' g'261' '6' silver-'942'ers '87' '19' furni'50'd '58'. A '344' imperial '6' ar'397'lical apparition of '7' unf'34'en, western '296', '265' to '4' '495' of '4' '261' trappers '6' hunters revived '4' glories of '200' primeval '464' '74' Adam '459'ed majestic as a '152', bluff-br'969'd '6' fear'759' as '14' '240'y steed. Whe'4'r marching amid '90' aides '6' marshals in '4' van of '893''759' cohorts '7' '398''759'ly streamed it '118' '4' plains, '46' an Ohio; or whe'4'r '31' '90' circumambient subjects browsing '34' '187' at '4' horizon, '4' W'479'e Steed g'34'opingly reviewed '116' '31' '869'm nostrils '796'dening '209' '90' '494' milkiness; in w'413'ver aspect he '986'ed '58''968', '194' to '4' bravest Indians he '28' '4' object of trembling r'167'ence '6' awe. Nor '51' it be questi'63'd '83' '11' st'6's on leg'398'ary record of '14' noble horse, '7' it '28' '90' spiritual whi'606'ess chiefly, '265' so c'202'hed '58' '31' divineness; '6' '7' '14' divineness '97' '7' in it '265', '463' com'128'ding worship, at '4' '276' '75' en'17'ced a '979' '275''759' terror.
But t'43' '36' '173' instances w'43' '14' whi'606'ess '521's '34' '7' accessory '6' st'868'ge glory '265' invests it in '4' W'479'e Steed '6' Albatross.
What is it '7' in '4' Albino '128' so peculiarly repels '6' of'606' shocks '4' '784', as '7' so'559'imes he is loa'4'd by '90' '249' kith '6' kin! It is '7' whi'606'ess '265' invests '58', a '124' expressed by '4' '275' he bears. The Albino is as '35' '721'e as '173' '508'—'129' no substantive de'17'mity—'6' '332' '14' mere aspect of '34'-pervading whi'606'ess '408' '58' '117' st'868'gely hideous '169' '4' ug'596'st abortion. Why '134' '14' be so?
Nor, in '538' '173' aspects, '185' Nature in '49' '402' palp'473' '33' '23' '4' '759' malicious agencies, fail to en'919' among '49' '17'ces '14' cr'249'ing attri'33'e of '4' '816'. From '716' s'56'y aspect, '4' g'976''123'ed ghost of '4' Sou'4'rn Seas '129' '91' denominated '4' W'479'e Squ'34'. Nor, in '96' '90'toric instances, '129' '4' art of hu'128' mal'972' omitted so po'606't an auxiliary. How wildly it heigh'606's '4' effect of '7' '962'age in Froissart, '74', m'257'ed in '4' s'56'y symbol of '238' '418'ion, '4' desperate W'479'e Hoods of Ghent '776' '238' bailiff in '4' market-'226'!
Nor, in '96' '124's, '185' '4' common, '43'ditary experience of '34' '128''207' fail to bear witness to '4' supernaturalism of '14' hue. It '51''23' '35' be doubted, '7' '4' '63' visible quality in '4' aspect of '4' '314' '265' '344' appals '4' gazer, is '4' marble p'34'or linge'847' t'43'; as if indeed '7' p'34'or '85' as '137' '46' '4' '217'ge of consternation in '4' '173' '296', as of mortal trepidation '43'. And '83' '7' p'34'or of '4' '314', we borrow '4' expressive hue of '4' shroud in '265' we wrap '116'. Nor '140' in '119' superstitions do we fail to '687' '4' '276' s'56'y '128'tle round '119' phantoms; '34' ghosts rising in a milk-'691' fog—Yea, '313' '182' terrors seize us, '123' us add, '7' '140' '4' king of terrors, '74' '369'ified by '4' evange'919', '852's on '90' p'34'id horse.
T'43''17'e, in '90' '173' moods, symbolize w'413'ver gr'6' or gracious '124' he '76' by whi'606'ess, no '128' '51' deny '7' in '716' pro'295'est '256'lized '659'ifi'51'ce it c'34's up a peculiar apparition to '4' soul.
But '463' '327' dis'708' '14' '378' be '950'ed, '60' is mortal '128' to ac'893' '17' it? To analyse it, '72' '562' im'622'. Can we, '98', by '4' citation of '96' of '200' instances w'43'in '14' '124' of whi'606'ess—'463' '17' '4' '75' ei'4'r '94'lly or in '164' '348' s'798'ped of '34' direct '652'ociations calcu'399'd to im'348' to it aught fearful, '33' n'167''4''759', is '295' to exert '118' us '4' '276' sorcery, '60''167' modified;—'51' we thus '274' to '703' upon '96' '365' clue to conduct us to '4' hidden ca'364' we '66'k?
Let us '244'. But in a '301' '46' '14', subt'123'y appeals to subt'123'y, '6' '327' imagination no '128' '51' '858' an'173' '155' '182' h'34's.

Why to '4' '128' of untuto'796' '256'lity, '94' '308's to be '33' loosely acquainted '31' '4' peculiar char'735'er of '4' '183', '185' '4' '960'e '508'tion of W'479'suntide marshal in '4' fancy '375' '192', dreary, speech'759' processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, d'249'-cast '6' hooded '31' '212'-f'34'en s'56'?

Or, to choose a '94'lly unsubstantial instance, purely ad'926'ed to '4' fancy, '65', in '504'ing '4' '261' '807'y tales of Central Europe, '185' "'4' t'34' pale '128'" of '4' Hartz fo'426's, '94'se '397''759' p'34'or unrustlingly glides '209' '4' green of '4' groves—'65' is '14' phantom '117' '816' '169' '34' '4' '94'oping imps of '4' Blocksburg?
Nor is it, alto'42''49', '4' rememb'868'ce of '49' ca'4'dral-'739'pling '987'quakes; nor '4' stampe'185' of '49' f'868'tic seas; nor '4' tear'759'ness of arid skies '7' n'167' rain; nor '4' sight of '49' wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-st'913', '6' crosses '34' adroop ('46' '51'ted yards of ancho'796' fleets); '6' '49' suburban avenues of ho'364'-w'34's '666' '118' upon '356' '173', as a tossed pack of '324'ds;—it is '23' '182' '124's al'63' '265' '106' tear'759' Lima, '4' st'868'gest, saddest '709' thou '51''st '66'. For Lima '129' '645' '4' '691' veil; '6' t'43' is a '530'er horror in '14' whi'606'ess of '49' woe. Old as Pizarro, '14' whi'606'ess '184's '49' ruins '17' '167' '212'; adm'716' '23' '4' cheerful greenness of comp'123'e decay; sp'504's '118' '49' '785'n ram'348's '4' rigid p'34'or of an apoplexy '7' '950'es '716' '249' distortions.
I k'56' '7', to '4' common apprehension, '14' pheno'508'on of whi'606'ess is '23' confessed to be '4' prime agent in exaggerating '4' terror of objects '173'wise '816'; nor to '4' unimaginative '241' is t'43' aught of terror in '200' appea'868'ces '94'se awfulness to an'173' '241' al'344' solely consists in '14' '63' pheno'508'on, especi'34'y '74' exhi'437'ed '447' '138' '17'm at '34' approaching to mu'606'ess or universality. What I '80' by '182' '149' '892''508'ts '289' '760' be '952'ively eluci'517'd by '4' '858'ing examples.
First: The mariner, '74' dra'768'g nigh '4' coasts of '17'eign l'6's, if by '168' he '230' '4' roar of '448'ers, '319's to vigilance, '6' '174's '22' '243' of trepidation to sharpen '34' '90' faculties; '33' '447' precisely similar circumstances, '123' '58' be c'34'ed '83' '90' hammock to view '90' ship sailing '209' a mid'168' sea of milky whi'606'ess—as if '83' encircling '342'l'6's shoals of com'515' '691' bears '85' swimming round '58', '98' he '174's a silent, superstitious d'504'; '4' shrouded phantom of '4' whi'606'ed '604's is horrible to '58' as a '272' ghost; in vain '4' lead '652'ures '58' he is s'773' '141' '602'ings; '374' '6' helm '69' '312' go d'249'; he n'167' '426's '773' blue '604' is '447' '58' '158'. Yet w'43' is '4' mariner '94' '76' '81' '4'e, "Sir, it '28' '23' so '137' '4' fear of striking hidden rocks, as '4' fear of '7' hideous whi'606'ess '7' so stir'796' me?"
Second: To '4' native Indian of Peru, '4' continual sight of '4' s'56''60'dahed Andes conveys naught of d'504', '722', '760', in '4' mere fancying of '4' eternal frosted desola'606'ess reigning at '375' vast altitudes, '6' '4' natural c'336'it of '11' a fearfulness it '72' be to '521' '913'elf in '375' inhu'128' solitudes. Much '4' '276' is it '31' '4' '78'woods'128' of '4' West, '94' '31' comparative indifference views an unbounded pr'769'ie '50'eted '31' '698'n s'56', no s'97'ow of tree or twig to '448' '4' '950'ed t'868'ce of whi'606'ess. Not so '4' sailor, be'956' '4' scenery of '4' Antarctic seas; w'43' at '464', by '96' infernal trick of legerdemain in '4' '637's of frost '6' '769', he, shive'847' '6' '499' shipwrecked, '861' of rainbows '613'ing '274' '6' solace to '90' misery, views '11' '562's a bound'759' churchyard grinning upon '58' '31' '716' lean '972' monu'508'ts '6' splinte'796' crosses.
But thou '99'est, '559'hinks '7' '691'-lead chapter '39' whi'606'ess is '33' a '691' flag hung '44' '83' a craven soul; thou surr'398'e'426' to a hypo, Ishmael.
Tell me, '65' '14' '777' '507' colt, foaled in '96' peaceful v'34'ey of Vermont, '458' re'367'd '83' '34' beasts of prey—'65' is it '7' upon '4' sunniest '183', if '1' '33' shake a fresh buffalo robe '528' '58', so '7' he '51''23' '140' '66' it, '33' '146' smells '716' wild animal muskiness—'65' '76' he '319', snort, '6' '31' bursting '495' paw '4' ground in phrensies of aff'40'? T'43' is no rememb'868'ce in '58' of '138' go'847's of wild cr'545'ures in '90' green nor'4'rn '179', so '7' '4' st'868'ge muskiness he smells '51''23' rec'34' to '58' '138''124' '652'ociated '31' '4' experience of '17'mer perils; '17' '11' '359' he, '14' New Engl'6' colt, of '4' '751' bi'273's of distant Oregon?
No; '33' '43' thou be'330'est '140' in a dumb brute, '4' instinct of '4' k'56'ledge of '4' demonism in '4' '296'. Though thous'6's of miles '83' Oregon, s'773' '74' he smells '7' savage musk, '4' r'398'ing, go'847' bi'273' '49'ds '36' as '986' as to '4' deserted wild foal of '4' pr'769'ies, '265' '14' instant '69' '289' be trampling '155' dust.
Thus, '98', '4' muffled rollings of a milky sea; '4' bleak rustlings of '4' festo'63'd frosts of mountains; '4' deso'399' shiftings of '4' '768'dr'969'd s'56's of pr'769'ies; '34' '182', to Ishmael, '36' as '4' shaking of '7' buffalo robe to '4' frigh'606'ed colt!
Though '948' '359' w'43' '596' '4' '275''759' '124's of '265' '4' mystic '659' '145's '17'th '375' hints; '332' '31' me, as '31' '4' colt, '96'w'43' '200' '124's '259' exist. Though in '128'y of '716' aspects '14' visible '296' '562's '17'med in '112', '4' invisible sp'43's '85' '17'med in f'40'.
But '23' '332' '19' we solved '4' in'51'tation of '14' whi'606'ess, '6' '819'ed '65' it appeals '31' '375' '637' to '4' soul; '6' '117' st'868'ge '6' '458' '117' por'606'tous—'65', as we '19' '333', it is at '336' '4' '344' '80'ing symbol of spiritual '124's, nay, '4' '131' veil of '4' '917'tian's Deity; '6' '332' '134' be as it is, '4' in'606'sifying agent in '124's '4' '344' app'34'ing to '128''207'.
Is it '7' by '716' indefini'606'ess it s'97'ows '17'th '4' '374''759' voids '6' im'508''421'ies of '4' universe, '6' thus stabs us '83' '528' '31' '4' '147' of annihilation, '74' be'956' '4' '691' depths of '4' milky '103'? Or is it, '7' as in essence whi'606'ess is '23' so '137' a col'119' as '4' visible absence of col'119'; '6' at '4' '276' '75' '4' concrete of '34' col'119's; is it '17' '182' '385's '7' t'43' is '375' a dumb blankness, '597' of '80'ing, in a wide l'6'scape of s'56's—a col'119''759', '34'-col'119' of a'4'ism '83' '265' we shrink? And '74' we con'500'r '7' '173' '4'ory of '4' natural philosop'49's, '7' '34' '173' '987'ly hues—e'131' '892'ly or '112'ly emblazoning—'4' '584' tinges of sun'451' skies '6' woods; yea, '6' '4' gilded velvets of '33'terf'596's, '6' '4' '33'terfly cheeks of '507' '641'; '34' '182' '36' '33' subtile dece'716', '23' '735'u'34'y in'43'nt in substances, '33' '146' laid on '83' '327'; so '7' '34' deified Nature '581' '684'ts '46' '4' har'202', '94'se '34'ure'508'ts c'118' no'124' '33' '4' charnel-ho'364' '31'in; '6' '74' we proceed fur'4'r, '6' con'500'r '7' '4' mystical cos'559'ic '265' produces e'131' '63' of '49' hues, '4' '164' principle of '703', '17' '167' remains '691' or col'119''759' in '716'elf, '6' if operating '327' medium upon '301', '72' '678' '34' objects, '140' tulips '6' roses, '31' '716' '249' blank tinge—ponde'847' '34' '14', '4' palsied universe '596's '165' us a leper; '6' '46' wilful travellers in Lapl'6', '94' ref'364' to '854' col'119'ed '6' col'119'ing gl'652'es upon '238' '495', so '4' wretched infidel gazes '58''968' blind at '4' monu'508'tal '691' shroud '7' wraps '34' '4' prospect '187' '58'.

CHAPTER 43. Hark!

"HIST! Did '1' '230' '7' noise, Cabaco?"
It '28' '4' '845'-'430'; a '807' moon'703'; '4' sea'508' '85' st'6'ing in a cordon, ex'606'ding '83' '63' of '4' fresh-'604' '33'ts in '4' waist, to '4' s'537'tle-'33't '958' '4' taffrail. In '14' '128'ner, '69' '962'ed '4' buckets to fill '4' s'537'tle-'33't. St'6'ing, '17' '4' '344' '348', on '4' h'34''969'd precincts of '4' quarter-deck, '69' '85' '324'eful '23' to '613' or rustle '238' '908'. From h'6' to h'6', '4' buckets '277' in '4' deepest silence, '146' '785'n by '4' occasional flap of a sail, '6' '4' steady hum of '4' unceasingly advancing keel.
It '28' in '4' midst of '14' repose, '7' Archy, '63' of '4' cordon, '94'se post '28' '958' '4' '180'-hatches, w'90'pe'796' to '90' neighbor, a Cholo, '4' '429's above.
"Hist! '64' '1' '230' '7' noise, Cabaco?"
"Take '4' bucket, '76' ye, Archy? '11' noise d'ye '80'?"
"T'43' it is '158'—'447' '4' hatches—'21' '1' '230' it—a cough—it '602'ed '46' a cough."
"Cough be '386'ed! P'652' '549' '7' re'391' bucket."
"T'43' '158'—t'43' it is!—it '602's '46' '149' or '291' '503'ers '391'ing '118', '56'!"
"Caramba! '19' d'63', shipmate, '76' ye? It's '4' '291' soaked biscu'716' ye '545' '17' supper '391'ing '118' in'500' of ye—no'124' '234'. Look to '4' bucket!"
"Say '11' ye '76', shipmate; '114' sharp ears."
"Aye, '1' '36' '4' chap, '594' ye, '7' '299' '4' hum of '4' '261' Quakeress's knitting-'107'les fifty miles at sea '83' Nantucket; '41' '4' chap."
"Grin '170'; '221' '66' '11' '391's up. Hark ye, Cabaco, t'43' is '96''618' d'249' in '4' '180'-'330' '7' '129' '23' '332' '91' '333' on deck; '6' I suspect '119' '261' Mogul '359' so'559'hing of it '111'. I '299' Stubb '81' Fl'257', '63' '339' '430', '7' t'43' '28' so'559'hing of '7' '563' in '4' '768'd."
"Tish! '4' bucket!"




CHAPTER 44. The Chart.

Had '1' '858'ed Captain Ahab d'249' '155' '90' cabin '180' '4' squ'34' '7' '111'k '226' on '4' '168' succeeding '7' wild ratification of '90' purpose '31' '90' crew, '1' '72' '19' '333' '58' go to a locker in '4' t'868'som, '6' b'847'ing '44' a large wrinkled roll of yello'392' sea charts, sp'504' '116' '165' '58' on '90' screwed-d'249' t'473'. Then s'545'ing '58''968' '165' it, '1' '72' '19' '333' '58' in'606'tly study '4' various '518's '6' s'97'ings '265' t'43' '559' '90' '784'; '6' '31' slow '33' steady pencil trace additional '239's '118' spaces '7' '165' '85' blank. At intervals, he '72' refer to piles of '261' log-'560's be'500' '58', w'43'in '85' '451' d'249' '4' sea'273's '6' '226's in '265', on various '17'mer voyages of various ships, sperm whales '97' '91' captu'796' or '333'.
While thus employed, '4' heavy pewter lamp susp'398'ed in chains '118' '90' '342', continu'34'y rocked '31' '4' motion of '4' ship, '6' '17' '167' threw shifting gleams '6' s'97'ows of '518's upon '90' wrinkled brow, '773' it al'344' '562'ed '7' '313' he '58''968' '28' marking '44' '518's '6' '239's on '4' wrinkled charts, '96' invisible pencil '28' '516' tracing '518's '6' '239's upon '4' deeply marked chart of '90' '17'e'342'.
But it '28' '23' '14' '168' in '348'icular '7', in '4' solitude of '90' cabin, Ahab thus ponde'796' '118' '90' charts. Al'344' e'131' '168' '69' '85' '561' '44'; al'344' e'131' '168' '96' pencil marks '85' ef'352'd, '6' '173's '85' substituted. For '31' '4' charts of '34' '492' oceans '165' '58', Ahab '28' th'504'ing a maze of currents '6' ed'474's, '31' a view to '4' '117' '979' accomplish'508't of '7' mono'128'iac '147' of '90' soul.
Now, to '138' '63' '23' '597'y acquainted '31' '4' '103's of '4' levia'169's, it '240' '562' an absurdly '274''759' t'257' thus to '66'k '44' '63' solitary cr'545'ure in '4' unhooped oceans of '14' '519'et. But '23' so '64' it '562' to Ahab, '94' k'212' '4' '451's of '34' tides '6' currents; '6' t'43'by calculating '4' driftings of '4' sperm whale's '696'; '6', '516', c'34'ing to '241' '4' regular, as'979'ed sea'273's '17' hunting '58' in '348'icular latitudes; '87' arrive at '385''473' surmises, al'344' approaching to '979'ties, c'336'rning '4' '75''596'st '183' to be upon '14' or '7' ground in search of '90' prey.
So '652'u'796', indeed, is '4' '418' c'336'rning '4' periodicalness of '4' sperm whale's re'563'ing to '145'n '604's, '7' '128'y hunters '172' '7', '87' he be '452'ly observed '6' stu'474'd '209''44' '4' '296'; '85' '4' logs '17' '63' voyage of '4' '797' whale fleet '324'e'597'y col'399'd, '98' '4' migrations of '4' sperm whale '72' be '295' to correspond in invariability to '200' of '4' '49''847'-shoals or '4' f'703's of sw'34'ows. On '14' hint, attempts '19' '91' '721'e to construct elaborate migratory charts of '4' sperm whale.*
     *Since '4' above '28' writ'606', '4' '892''508't is happily borne
     '44' by an '141'icial circular, issued by Lieu'606'ant Maury, of
     '4' National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By
     '7' circular, it appears '7' precisely '375' a chart is in
     '239' of comp'123'ion; '6' portions of it '36' '986'ed in
     '4' circular. "T'90' chart divides '4' ocean '155' districts
     of '401' degrees of latitude by '401' degrees of '192'itude;
     perp'398'icularly '209' '356' of '265' districts '36' twelve
     columns '17' '4' twelve '611'; '6' horizont'34'y '209' '356'
     of '265' districts '36' '291' '518's; '63' to s'60' '4' '539'
     of '433' '7' '19' '91' '953' in '356' month in e'131'
     district, '6' '4' '149' '173's to s'60' '4' '539' of '433' in
     '265' whales, sperm or '40', '19' '91' '333'."
Be'500's, '74' '380' a '962'age '83' '63' feeding-ground to an'173', '4' sperm whales, guided by '96' inf'34'ible instinct—'99', '743', '669' in'81'igence '83' '4' Deity—'344'ly swim in veins, as '69' '36' c'34'ed; continuing '238' '103' '549' a '145'n ocean-'518' '31' '375' undeviating ex'735'itude, '7' no ship '167' sailed '49' '239', by '138' chart, '31' '63' ti'4' of '375' marvellous precision. Though, in '182' '390's, '4' direction '645' by '138' '63' whale be '688' as a surveyor's par'34'el, '6' '463' '4' '518' of advance be strictly con'178'd to '716' '249' unavoid'473', '688' '830', '332' '4' ar'437'rary vein in '265' at '182' '464' he is '136' to swim, gener'34'y embraces '96' '360' miles in width ('117' or '759', as '4' vein is presumed to exp'6' or contr'735'); '33' n'167' exceeds '4' visual sweep '83' '4' whale-ship's mast-'342's, '74' circumspectly gliding '549' '14' magic z'63'. The sum is, '7' at '348'icular sea'273's '31'in '7' b'504'th '6' '549' '7' path, migrating whales '289' '31' '164' confidence be '720' '17'.
And hence '23' '146' at substantiated '464', upon '35' '677' separate feeding-grounds, '87' Ahab '274' to en'893'er '90' prey; '33' in crossing '4' widest expanses of '604' '592'ween '200' grounds he '87', by '90' art, so '226' '6' '75' '58''968' on '90' '103', as '140' '98' '23' to be '94'lly '327' prospect of a '381'ing.
T'43' '28' a circumstance '265' at '171' sight '562'ed to entangle '90' delirious '33' s'773' '559'hodical scheme. But '23' so in '4' '272'ity, '760'. Though '4' gregarious sperm whales '19' '238' regular sea'273's '17' '348'icular grounds, '332' in general '1' '51''23' conclude '7' '4' '49'ds '265' h'976'ed '375' '6' '375' a latitude or '192'itude '14' '407', '99', '76' '391' '44' to be identic'34'y '4' '276' '31' '200' '7' '85' '295' t'43' '4' preceding sea'273'; '463' t'43' '36' peculiar '6' un'455''473' instances w'43' '4' contrary of '14' '129' '831'd '354'. In general, '4' '276' remark, '146' '31'in a '759' wide limit, app'596's to '4' solitaries '6' '49'm'716' among '4' matu'796', aged sperm whales. So '7' '463' Moby Dick '97' in a '17'mer '407' '91' '333', '17' example, on '11' is c'34'ed '4' Seyc'245'e ground in '4' Indian ocean, or Vol'51'o Bay on '4' Japanese Coast; '332' it '64' '23' '858', '7' '85' '4' Pequod to vi'421' ei'4'r of '200' spots at '138' subsequent corresponding sea'273', '50' '72' inf'34'ibly en'893'er '58' t'43'. So, '111', '31' '96' '173' feeding grounds, w'43' he '97' at '464' revealed '58''968'. But '34' '182' '562'ed '146' '90' casual '188'ping-'226's '6' ocean-inns, so to '613', '23' '90' '226's of pro'192'ed abode. And w'43' Ahab's '365's of accomplishing '90' object '19' '479''49'to '91' spoken of, '34'usion '129' '146' '91' '721'e to w'413'ver '103'-'500', antecedent, extra prospects '85' '90', ere a '348'icular '451' '75' or '226' '85' attained, '74' '34' possibilities '72' be'67' probabilities, '6', as Ahab fondly '147', e'131' possibility '4' '290' '124' to a '979'ty. That '348'icular '451' '75' '6' '226' '85' conjoined in '4' '63' technical phrase—'4' Sea'273'-on-'4'-Line. For t'43' '6' '98', '17' s'167'al conse'537'ive '266', Moby Dick '97' '91' periodic'34'y descried, linge'847' in '200' '604's '17' a'313', as '4' sun, in '716' annual round, loiters '17' a p'796'icted interval in '138' '63' '659' of '4' Zodiac. T'43' it '28', '111', '7' '344' of '4' '314'ly en'893'ers '31' '4' '691' whale '97' '645' '226'; t'43' '4' waves '85' storied '31' '90' deeds; t'43' '516' '28' '7' tragic spot w'43' '4' mono'128'iac '261' '128' '97' '295' '4' awful motive to '90' vengeance. But in '4' cautious comprehensiveness '6' unloite'847' vigilance '31' '265' Ahab threw '90' brooding soul '155' '14' unfalte'847' hunt, he '72' '23' permit '58''968' to '426' '34' '90' '274's upon '4' '63' cr'249'ing '418' above '508'ti'63'd, '60''167' flatte'847' it '240' be to '200' '274's; nor in '4' '503''759'ness of '90' vow '87' he so t'868'quillize '90' un'935' '374' as to postp'63' '34' intervening quest.
Now, '4' Pequod '97' sailed '83' Nantucket at '4' '131' beginning of '4' Sea'273'-on-'4'-Line. No '622' '398'eavor '98' '87' en'473' '49' com'128'der to '106' '4' '164' '962'age s'44'h'869'ds, double Cape Horn, '6' '98' '573' d'249' '578'ty degrees of latitude arrive in '4' equatorial Pacific in '75' to cruise t'43'. T'43''17'e, he '259' '154' '17' '4' '290' ensuing sea'273'. Yet '4' premature '612' of '4' Pequod's sailing '97', '760', '91' correctly selected by Ahab, '31' a view to '14' '131' complexion of '124's. Beca'364', an interval of '291' hund'796' '6' '578'ty-'401' '433' '6' '168's '28' '165' '58'; an interval '265', '861' of impatiently '398'u'847' ashore, he '72' sp'398' in a miscellaneous hunt; if by '365' '4' W'479'e Whale, sp'398'ing '90' vacation in seas '458' remote '83' '90' periodical feeding-grounds, '134' '391' up '90' wrinkled brow '141' '4' Persian Gulf, or in '4' '742'gal Bay, or China Seas, or in '138' '173' '604's h'976'ed by '90' race. So '7' Mon'358's, Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; '138' '768'd '33' '4' Levanter '6' Simoon, '240' blow Moby Dick '155' '4' devious zig-zag '296'-circle of '4' Pequod's circumnavigating '830'.
But g'868'ting '34' '14'; '332', regarded discreetly '6' '494'ly, '562's it '23' '33' a '721' '256', '14'; '7' in '4' b'937' bound'759' ocean, '63' solitary whale, '140' if en'893'e'796', '134' be '147' cap'473' of individual recognition '83' '90' hunter, '140' as a '691'-bearded Mufti in '4' thronged thoroughf'36's of Constantinople? Yes. For '4' peculiar s'56'-'691' brow of Moby Dick, '6' '90' s'56'-'691' hump, '87' '23' '33' be unmistak'473'. And '19' I '23' t'34'ied '4' whale, Ahab '72' mutter to '58''968', as '180' po'847' '118' '90' charts '773' '192' '180' mid'168' he '72' '687' '58''968' '78' in r'167'ies—t'34'ied '58', '6' sh'34' he escape? His b'937' fins '36' bo'796', '6' sc'34'oped '44' '46' a '387' '50'ep's ear! And '43', '90' '721' '241' '72' '366' on in a br'545'h'759' race; '773' a '854'iness '6' faintness of ponde'847' '246' '118' '58'; '6' in '4' '422' '769' of '4' deck he '72' '66'k to rec'118' '90' strength. Ah, God! '11' t'868'ces of tor'508'ts '185' '7' '128' '398'ure '94' is consumed '31' '63' unachieved r'140'geful de'284'e. He '503's '31' clenched '524'; '6' '830's '31' '90' '249' '593'y nails in '90' palms.
Of'606', '74' '17'ced '83' '90' hammock by exhausting '6' '155'lerably vivid '710's of '4' '168', '265', resuming '90' '249' in'606'se '147's '209' '4' '183', '324'ried '116' on amid a clashing of phrensies, '6' whirled '116' round '6' round '6' round in '90' blazing brain, '773' '4' '131' throbbing of '90' '139'-spot be'246' insuffer'473' anguish; '6' '74', as '28' so'559'imes '4' '390', '182' spiritual throes in '58' heaved '90' '213' up '83' '716' base, '6' a c'129'm '562'ed '422'ing in '58', '83' '265' '17'ked flames '6' '703'nings s'576' up, '6' accursed fi'398's beck'63'd '58' to leap d'249' among '116'; '74' '14' '245' in '58''968' yawned ben'545'h '58', a wild cry '72' be '299' '209' '4' ship; '6' '31' gla'847' '495' Ahab '72' burst '83' '90' '892' '267', as '463' escaping '83' a '515' '7' '28' on '522'. Yet '182', '760', '861' of '213' '4' unsuppress'473' symptoms of '96' la'606't weakness, or f'40' at '90' '249' resolve, '85' '33' '4' plainest tokens of '716' in'606''421'y. For, at '375' '464', '419' Ahab, '4' scheming, unappeasedly stead'692' hunter of '4' '691' whale; '14' Ahab '7' '97' g'63' to '90' hammock, '28' '23' '4' agent '7' so ca'364'd '58' to burst '83' it in horror '158'. The latter '28' '4' eternal, '565' principle or soul in '58'; '6' in '503', '213' '17' '4' '75' dissociated '83' '4' char'735'erizing '241', '265' at '173' '464' employed it '17' '716' '44'er vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape '83' '4' scorching contiguity of '4' f'868'tic '124', of '265', '17' '4' '75', it '28' no '192'er an integral. But as '4' '241' '185' '23' exist un'759' leagued '31' '4' soul, t'43''17'e it '259' '19' '91' '7', in Ahab's '390', yielding up '34' '90' '147's '6' fancies to '90' '63' supreme purpose; '7' purpose, by '716' '249' '50'er inveteracy of '76', '17'ced '716'elf '485' '152's '6' d'779's '155' a '207' of '968'-'652'umed, indep'398'ent '213' of '716' '249'.

CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.

So '458' as '11' t'43' '289' be of a narrative in '14' '560'; '6', indeed, as indirectly '678'ing '63' or '149' '131' '928' '6' curious '348'iculars in '4' hab'716' of sperm whales, '4' '17'e'45' chapter, in '716' ear'596'r '348', is as '425' a '63' as '76' be '295' in '14' volume; '33' '4' leading '301' of it requires to be s'773' fur'4'r '6' '117' familiarly enlarged upon, in '619' to be adequately '447's'111'd, '6' '117''118' to '101' '170' '138' inc'796'ulity '265' a pro'295' igno'868'ce of '4' '797' subject '289' induce in '96' '241's, as to '4' natural verity of '4' main '378's of '14' af'807'.
I '324'e '23' to per'17'm '14' '348' of my t'257' '559'hodic'34'y; '33' sh'34' be con'606't to produce '4' de'284'ed impression by separate citations of items, pr'735'ic'34'y or reliably '677' to me as a whale'128'; '6' '83' '182' citations, I '101' it—'4' conclusion aimed at '76' natur'34'y '858' of '716'elf.
First: I '19' '369''34'y '677' '291' instances w'43' a whale, '180' receiving a harpoon, '129' effected a comp'123'e escape; '6', '180' an interval (in '63' instance of '291' '266'), '129' '91' '158' struck by '4' '276' h'6', '6' slain; '74' '4' '149' irons, '312' marked by '4' '276' '988' cyp'49', '19' '91' '645' '83' '4' '618'. In '4' instance w'43' '291' '266' intervened '592'ween '4' flinging of '4' '149' harpoons; '6' I '54' it '289' '19' '91' so'559'hing '117' '169' '7'; '4' '128' '94' darted '116' '308'ing, in '4' interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, '277' ashore t'43', joined a disco'131' '348'y, '6' penetrated '458' '155' '4' interior, w'43' he travelled '17' a period of '958'ly '149' '266', of'606' '398'ange'796' by serpents, savages, tigers, poi'273'ous miasmas, '31' '34' '4' '173' common perils incident to w'6'e'847' in '4' '374' of un'677' regions. Mean'313', '4' whale he '97' struck '259' '516' '19' '91' on '716' travels; no doubt it '97' thr'972' circumnavigated '4' globe, brushing '31' '716' flanks '34' '4' coasts of Africa; '33' to no purpose. T'90' '128' '6' '14' whale '158' '246' to'42''49', '6' '4' '63' vanqui'50'd '4' '173'. I '99' I, '302', '19' '677' '291' instances similar to '14'; '7' is in '149' of '116' I '282' '4' whales struck; '6', upon '4' '347' attack, '282' '4' '149' irons '31' '4' '952'ive marks '537' in '116', '180''869'ds '645' '83' '4' '314' fish. In '4' '291'-'407' instance, it so '947' '44' '7' I '28' in '4' boat '312' '464', '171' '6' '181', '6' '4' '181' '75' distinctly recognised a peculiar '563' of huge mole '447' '4' whale's '784', '265' I '97' observed t'43' '291' '266' previous. I '99' '291' '266', '33' I am '281' '115' it '28' '117' '169' '7'. Here '36' '291' instances, '98', '265' I '369''34'y k'56' '4' '350' of; '33' I '19' '299' of '128'y '173' instances '83' '369's '94'se vera'709' in '4' '301' t'43' is no '68' ground to imp'356'.
Secondly: It is '35' '677' in '4' Sperm Whale Fi'50'ry, '60''167' igno'868't '4' '296' ashore '289' be of it, '7' t'43' '19' '91' s'167'al memor'473' '90'torical instances w'43' a '348'icular whale in '4' ocean '129' '91' at distant '464' '6' '226's popularly cognis'473'. Why '375' a whale be'246' thus marked '28' '23' alto'42''49' '6' origin'34'y o'768'g to '90' bodily peculiarities as distingui'50'd '83' '173' whales; '17' '60''167' peculiar in '7' '952' '138' '365' whale '289' be, '69' '358' '186' an '398' to '90' peculiarities by '320'ing '58', '6' boiling '58' d'249' '155' a peculiarly valu'473' oil. No: '4' '385' '28' '14': '7' '83' '4' fatal experiences of '4' fi'50'ry t'43' hung a '816' p'426'ige of perilousness '39' '375' a whale as t'43' '64' '39' Rinaldo Rinaldini, inso'137' '7' '344' fi'50'r'508' '85' con'606't to recognise '58' by merely '678'ing '238' tarpaulins '74' he '72' be disc'118'ed lounging by '116' on '4' sea, '327' '66'king to cultivate a '117' intimate acquaintance. Like '96' '719' d'779's ashore '7' '308' to k'56' an irascible '164' '128', '69' '106' distant unobtrusive salutations to '58' in '4' '811', lest if '69' pursued '4' acquaintance fur'4'r, '69' '240' receive a summary thump '17' '238' presumption.
But '23' '146' '64' '356' of '182' famous whales '932' '164' individual celebrity—Nay, '1' '289' c'34' it an ocean-wide re'56'n; '23' '146' '28' he famous in '139' '6' '56' is immortal in '17'ecastle stories '180' '548', '33' he '28' '774'ted '155' '34' '4' '40's, privileges, '6' distinctions of a '275'; '97' as '137' a '275' indeed as Cambyses or Caesar. Was it '23' so, O Timor Tom! thou famed levia'169', s'324''796' '46' an '972'berg, '94' so '192' '64''st lurk in '4' Oriental stra'716' of '7' '275', '94'se sp'44' '28' oft '333' '83' '4' palmy b'356' of Ombay? Was it '23' so, O New Zeal'6' '254'! thou terror of '34' cruisers '7' crossed '238' '830's in '4' vicinity of '4' Tat'111' L'6'? Was it '23' so, O Morquan! King of Japan, '94'se lofty jet '69' '99' at '464' '652'umed '4' semblance of a s'56'-'691' cross '485' '4' sky? Was it '23' so, O Don '874'! thou Chilian whale, marked '46' an '261' tortoise '31' mystic hieroglyphics upon '4' '78'! In plain prose, '43' '36' '492' whales as '35' '677' to '4' students of Cetacean Hi'480' as Marius or Sylla to '4' cl'652'ic scholar.
But '14' is '23' '34'. New Zeal'6' Tom '6' Don '874', '180' at various '464' cr'545'ing '164' havoc among '4' boats of '465' vessels, '85' fin'34'y g'63' in quest of, systematic'34'y hunted '44', c'129'ed '6' '466' by valiant whaling captains, '94' heaved up '238' anchors '31' '7' express object as '137' in view, as in '451'ting '44' '209' '4' Narragan'451't Woods, Captain Butler of '261' '97' it in '90' '241' to capture '7' '23'orious '776'ous savage Annawon, '4' '342''344' '869'rior of '4' Indian King Philip.
I do '23' k'56' w'43' I '51' '156' a '166' '226' '169' '22' '43', to '106' '508'tion of '63' or '149' '173' '124's, '265' to me '562' '425', as in printed '17'm establishing in '34' '952's '4' '385''473'ness of '4' '251' '480' of '4' W'479'e Whale, '117' especi'34'y '4' catastrophe. For '14' is '63' of '200' di'50'ar'606'ing instances w'43' '350' requires '597' as '137' bolste'847' as error. So igno'868't '36' '344' l'6's'508' of '96' of '4' plainest '6' '344' palp'473' '683's of '4' '296', '7' '327' '96' hints '678'ing '4' plain '418's, '90'torical '6' '173'wise, of '4' fi'50'ry, '69' '240' sc'44' at Moby Dick as a monstrous f'473', or s'773' '623' '6' '117' de'704''473', a hideous '6' '155'ler'473' '34'egory.
First: Though '344' '508' '19' '96' vague flitting '256's of '4' general perils of '4' gr'6' fi'50'ry, '332' '69' '19' no'124' '46' a '950'ed, vivid c'336'ption of '200' perils, '6' '4' frequency '31' '265' '69' recur. One '385' '760' is, '7' '23' '63' in fifty of '4' '735'ual disasters '6' '548's by casualties in '4' fi'50'ry, '167' '156's a public record at '179', '60''167' t'868'sient '6' immediately '17''61''606' '7' record. Do '1' '803' '7' '7' '719' '947'ow t'43', '94' '14' mo'508't '760' '808' by '4' whale-'518' '141' '4' coast of New Guinea, is '213' '324'ried d'249' to '4' bottom of '4' sea by '4' '602'ing levia'169'—do '1' '803' '7' '7' '719' '947'ow's '275' '76' appear in '4' '212's'888' o'437'uary '1' '76' '504' to-morrow at y'119' '448''692'? No: beca'364' '4' mails '36' '131' irregular '592'ween '43' '6' New Guinea. In '418', '64' '1' '167' '230' '11' '240' be c'34'ed regular '212's direct or indirect '83' New Guinea? Yet I '81' '1' '7' upon '63' '348'icular voyage '265' I '721'e to '4' Pacific, among '128'y '173's we spoke thirty '465' ships, e'131' '63' of '265' '97' '97' a '548' by a whale, '96' of '116' '117' '169' '63', '6' '291' '7' '97' '356' '387' a boat's crew. For God's '997', be economical '31' y'119' lamps '6' '51'dles! '23' a g'34'on '1' burn, '33' at '402' '63' '705' of '128''s '593' '28' spilled '17' it.
Secondly: People ashore '19' indeed '96' indefinite '256' '7' a whale is an enormous cr'545'ure of enormous '637'; '33' I '19' '167' '295' '7' '74' narrating to '116' '96' specific example of '14' '149'-f'261' enormousness, '69' '19' '659'ifi'51'tly compli'508'ted me upon my '352'tiousness; '74', I decl'36' upon my soul, I '97' no '117' '256' of '213' '352'tious '169' Moses, '74' he wrote '4' '903' of '4' plagues of Egypt.
But '17'tunately '4' '591' '378' I '43' '66'k '51' be establi'50'd upon '704'imony '797'ly indep'398'ent of my '249'. That '378' is '14': The Sperm Whale is in '96' '390's sufficiently '637'ful, kno'768'g, '6' judiciously malicious, as '31' direct a'17'e'147' to stave in, utterly destroy, '6' sink a large ship; '6' '11' is '117', '4' Sperm Whale '129' d'63' it.
First: In '4' '407' 1820 '4' ship Es'640', Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, '28' cruising in '4' Pacific Ocean. One '183' '50' '282' sp'44's, l'969''796' '49' boats, '6' '417' c'129'e to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere '192', s'167'al of '4' whales '85' wounded; '74', suddenly, a '131' large whale escaping '83' '4' boats, issued '83' '4' shoal, '6' bore directly d'249' upon '4' ship. Dashing '90' '17'e'342' '485' '49' hull, he so stove '49' in, '7' in '759' '169' "'606' '294's" '50' '451'tled d'249' '6' '947' '118'. Not a surviving '519'k of '49' '129' '91' '333' '317'. After '4' s'167'est expo'115', '348' of '4' crew r'356'ed '4' l'6' in '238' boats. Being re'391'ed '179' at '181', Captain Pollard '336' '117' sailed '17' '4' Pacific in com'128'd of an'173' ship, '33' '4' '152's shipwrecked '58' '158' upon un'677' rocks '6' '448'ers; '17' '4' '347' '75' '90' ship '28' utterly '387', '6' '17'th'31' '17''746'ing '4' sea, he '129' n'167' tempted it '317'. At '14' '183' Captain Pollard is a re'500'nt of Nantucket. I '19' '333' Owen Chace, '94' '28' chief mate of '4' Es'640' at '4' '75' of '4' tragedy; I '19' '504' '90' plain '6' faithful narrative; I '19' conversed '31' '90' '273'; '6' '34' '14' '31'in a '360' miles of '4' scene of '4' catastrophe.*
*The '858'ing '36' extr'735's '83' Chace's narrative: "E'131' '418' '562'ed to '869''868't me in concluding '7' it '28' '138''124' '33' '365' '265' directed '90' operations; he '721'e '149' s'167'al attacks upon '4' ship, at a '940' interval '592'ween '116', '312' of '265', according to '238' direction, '85' calcu'399'd to do us '4' '344' injury, by '213' '721'e '531', '6' t'43'by combining '4' speed of '4' '149' objects '17' '4' shock; to effect '265', '4' ex'735' '128'oeuvres '265' he '721'e '85' necessary. His aspect '28' '344' horrible, '6' '375' as indicated re'708''508't '6' fury. He '246' directly '83' '4' shoal '265' we '97' '22' '165' ente'796', '6' in '265' we '97' struck '291' of '90' companions, as if fi'796' '31' r'140'ge '17' '238' suffe'847's." Again: "At '34' '140'ts, '4' '251' circumstances '645' to'42''49', '34' '308'ing '165' my '249' '495', '6' producing, at '4' '75', impressions in my '241' of '750', calculating mischief, on '4' '348' of '4' whale ('128'y of '265' impressions I '51''23' '56' rec'34'), induce me to be satisfied '7' I am correct in my opinion."
Here '36' '90' reflections '96' '75' '180' quitting '4' ship, du'847' a '751' '168' in an '422' boat, '74' al'344' despai'847' of r'356'ing '138' hospit'473' shore. "The '967' ocean '6' s'35'ing '604's '85' no'124'; '4' fears of '213' sw'34''969'd up by '96' d'504'ful tempest, or da'50'd upon hidden rocks, '31' '34' '4' '173' ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, '562'ed s'324'cely entitled to a mo'508't's '147'; '4' dismal '262' wreck, '6' '4' horrid aspect '6' r'140'ge of '4' whale, '94'lly engrossed my reflections, '326' '183' '158' '721'e '716' appea'868'ce."
In an'173' '226'—p. 45,—he '613's of "'4' mysterious '6' mortal attack of '4' animal."
Secondly: The ship Union, '516' of Nantucket, '28' in '4' '407' 1807 tot'34'y '387' '141' '4' Azores by a similar on'451', '33' '4' au'98'tic '348'iculars of '14' catastrophe I '19' n'167' '365'd to en'893'er, '463' '83' '4' whale hunters I '19' '56' '6' '98' '299' casual '34'usions to it.
Thirdly: Some '879'een or t'277'y '266' '414' Commodore J—-, '98' com'128'ding an Ameri'51' sloop-of-'869' of '4' '171' cl'652', '203' to be dining '31' a '348'y of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in '4' harbor of Oahu, S'6'wich Isl'6's. Conversation '391'ing upon whales, '4' Commodore '28' '142'd to be sceptical '678'ing '4' '738' strength ascri'515' to '116' by '4' professional gentle'508' '986'. He peremptorily denied '17' example, '7' '138' whale '87' so smite '90' st'44' sloop-of-'869' as to ca'364' '49' to leak so '137' as a t'58'bleful. Very '68'; '33' t'43' is '117' '260'. Some '731' '180', '4' Commodore '451' sail in '14' impregn'473' craft '17' Valparaiso. But he '28' '188'ped on '4' '103' by a portly sperm whale, '7' begged a '360' mo'508'ts' confidential '355' '31' '58'. That '355' consisted in fetching '4' Commodore's craft '375' a thwack, '7' '31' '34' '90' pumps '45' he '721'e '688' '17' '4' '958'est port to heave d'249' '6' rep'769'. I am '23' superstitious, '33' I con'500'r '4' Commodore's interview '31' '7' whale as providential. Was '23' Saul of Tarsus converted '83' unbe'596'f by a similar f'40'? I '81' '1', '4' sperm whale '76' st'6' no non'587'.
I '76' '56' refer '1' to Langsdorff's Voyages '17' a '105' circumstance in '378', peculiarly '928' to '4' '863'r '43'of. Langsdorff, '1' '259' k'56' by '4' '103', '28' attached to '4' Russian Admiral Kr'364'nstern's famous Disco'131' Expedition in '4' beginning of '4' '986' century. Captain Langsdorff thus begins '90' s'140'teenth chapter:
"By '4' thirteenth of May '119' ship '28' '325' to sail, '6' '4' '290' '183' we '85' '44' in '4' '422' sea, on '119' '103' to Oc'576'sh. The wea'4'r '28' '131' '574' '6' '178', '33' so '155'lerably '690' '7' we '85' obliged to '184' on '119' fur clo'124'. For '96' '433' we '97' '131' '105' '768'd; it '28' '23' '773' '4' nineteenth '7' a brisk gale '83' '4' northwest sp'868'g up. An uncommon large whale, '4' '618' of '265' '28' larger '169' '4' ship '716'elf, lay al'344' at '4' sur'352' of '4' '604', '33' '28' '23' perceived by '138' '63' on board '773' '4' mo'508't '74' '4' ship, '265' '28' in '597' sail, '28' al'344' upon '58', so '7' it '28' im'622' to pr'140't '716' striking '485' '58'. We '85' thus '226'd in '4' '344' im'462'nt danger, as '14' gigantic cr'545'ure, '451'ting up '716' '78', raised '4' ship '291' '908' at '402' '44' of '4' '604'. The masts reeled, '6' '4' sails '947' alto'42''49', '313' we '94' '85' below '34' sp'868'g instantly upon '4' deck, concluding '7' we '97' struck upon '96' rock; '861' of '14' we '282' '4' monster sailing '141' '31' '4' ut'344' gravity '6' solemnity. Captain D'Wolf app'596'd immediately to '4' pumps to exa'462' whe'4'r or '23' '4' vessel '97' received '138' damage '83' '4' shock, '33' we '295' '7' '131' happily it '97' escaped '797'ly uninju'796'."
Now, '4' Captain D'Wolf '43' '34'uded to as com'128'ding '4' ship in '455', is a New Engl'6'er, '94', '180' a '192' '139' of unusual adventures as a sea-captain, '14' '183' re'500's in '4' village of Dorchester '958' Boston. I '19' '4' hon'119' of '213' a nephew of '90'. I '19' '348'icularly questi'63'd '58' c'336'rning '14' '962'age in Langsdorff. He substantiates e'131' '429'. The ship, '60''167', '28' by no '410' a large '63': a Russian craft built on '4' Siberian coast, '6' purc'129'ed by my uncle '180' '960'te'847' '170' '4' vessel in '265' he sailed '83' '179'.
In '7' up '6' d'249' '128'ly '560' of '261'-fashi'63'd adventure, so '597', '111', of h'913't '683's—'4' voyage of Li'63'l Wafer, '63' of ancient Dampier's '261' chums—I '295' a '105' '301' '451' d'249' so '46' '7' '22' quoted '83' Langsdorff, '7' I '51''23' '17'bear inserting it '43' '17' a corroborative example, if '375' be '643'.
Li'63'l, it '562's, '28' on '90' '103' to "'608' Ferdin'6'o," as he c'34's '4' modern Juan Fern'6'es. "In '119' '103' t'479''49'," he '415', "'39' '492' o'clock in '4' '339', '74' we '85' '39' '63' hund'796' '6' fifty leagues '83' '4' Main of America, '119' ship '577' a '816' shock, '265' '186' '119' '508' in '375' consternation '7' '69' '87' '321'ly '81' w'43' '69' '85' or '11' to '54'; '33' e'131' '63' began to prep'36' '17' '548'. And, indeed, '4' shock '28' so sudden '6' violent, '7' we '111'k it '17' g'868'ted '4' ship '97' struck '485' a rock; '33' '74' '4' amaze'508't '28' a '105' '118', we cast '4' lead, '6' '602'ed, '33' '295' no ground..... The suddenness of '4' shock '721'e '4' '723's leap in '238' '324'riages, '6' s'167'al of '4' '508' '85' shaken '44' of '238' hammocks. Captain Davis, '94' lay '31' '90' '342' on a '723', '28' '687'n '44' of '90' cabin!" Li'63'l '98' '547' on to im'186'e '4' shock to an '987'quake, '6' '562's to substantiate '4' im'186'ation by stating '7' a '164' '987'quake, '96'w'43' '39' '7' '75', '64' '735'u'34'y do '164' mischief '549' '4' Spanish l'6'. But I '134' '23' '137' '683' if, in '4' '967'ness of '7' '865' '612' of '4' '339', '4' shock '28' '180' '34' ca'364'd by an un'333' whale vertic'34'y bumping '4' hull '83' ben'545'h.
I '240' proceed '31' s'167'al '117' examples, '63' '103' or an'173' '677' to me, of '4' '164' '637' '6' mal'972' at '464' of '4' sperm whale. In '117' '169' '63' instance, he '129' '91' '677', '23' '146' to c'129'e '4' '652'ailing boats '78' to '238' ships, '33' to pursue '4' ship '716'elf, '6' '192' '31'st'6' '34' '4' lances hurled at '58' '83' '716' decks. The English ship Pusie H'34' '51' '81' a '480' on '7' '342'; '6', as '17' '90' strength, '123' me '99', '7' t'43' '19' '91' examples w'43' '4' '518's attached to a '573' sperm whale '19', in a '804', '91' t'868'sfer'796' to '4' ship, '6' secu'796' t'43'; '4' whale to'768'g '49' '164' hull '209' '4' '604', as a horse '459's '141' '31' a '324't. Again, it is '131' of'606' observed '7', if '4' sperm whale, '336' struck, is '34''969'd '75' to r'34'y, he '98' '735's, '23' so of'606' '31' blind rage, as '31' wilful, deliberate de'659's of destruction to '90' pursuers; nor is it '327' conveying '96' eloquent indication of '90' char'735'er, '7' upon '213' attacked he '76' frequently '422' '90' '843', '6' retain it in '7' d'504' expansion '17' s'167'al conse'537'ive '294's. But I '259' be con'606't '31' '146' '63' '117' '6' a concluding illustration; a remark'473' '6' '344' '659'ifi'51't '63', by '265' '1' '76' '23' fail to '66', '7' '23' '146' is '4' '344' marvellous '140't in '14' '560' corroborated by plain '418's of '4' '986' '183', '33' '7' '182' marvels ('46' '34' marvels) '36' mere repetitions of '4' ages; so '7' '17' '4' '827'th '75' we '99' a'508' '31' Solomon—Verily t'43' is no'124' '212' '447' '4' sun.
In '4' '578'th '917'tian century '349'd Procopius, a '917'tian magistrate of Constantinople, in '4' '433' '74' Justinian '28' Emperor '6' Belisarius general. As '128'y k'56', he wrote '4' '903' of '90' '249' '464', a '176' e'131' '103' of uncommon value. By '4' '258' authorities, he '129' '194' '91' con'500''796' a '344' '395''736'y '6' unexaggerating '90'torian, '722' in '96' '63' or '149' '348'iculars, '23' at '34' affecting '4' '301' '986'ly to be '508'ti'63'd.
Now, in '14' '903' of '90', Procopius '508'tions '7', du'847' '4' term of '90' prefecture at Constantinople, a '164' sea-monster '28' captu'796' in '4' neighbo'847' Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, '180' '305' destroyed vessels at intervals in '200' '604's '17' a period of '117' '169' fifty '266'. A '418' thus '451' d'249' in substantial '903' '51''23' easily be gain'136'. Nor is t'43' '138' '385' it '134' be. Of '11' precise species '14' sea-monster '28', is '23' '508'ti'63'd. But as he destroyed ships, as '35' as '17' '173' '385's, he '259' '19' '91' a whale; '6' I am '777'ly inc'518'd to '54' a sperm whale. And I '76' '81' '1' '65'. For a '192' '75' I fancied '7' '4' sperm whale '97' '91' '194' un'677' in '4' Mediter'868'ean '6' '4' deep '604's connecting '31' it. '938'n '56' I am '979' '7' '200' seas '36' '23', '6' '760' n'167' '51' be, in '4' '986' constitution of '124's, a '226' '17' '90' ha'437'ual gregarious re'563'. But fur'4'r investigations '19' recently '831'd to me, '7' in modern '464' t'43' '19' '91' iso'399'd instances of '4' presence of '4' sperm whale in '4' Mediter'868'ean. I am '163', on '68' authority, '7' on '4' Bar'960'y coast, a Commodore Davis of '4' British navy '295' '4' ske'123'on of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of '869' '504'ily '962'es '209' '4' Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale '87', by '4' '276' r'44'e, '962' '44' of '4' Mediter'868'ean '155' '4' Propontis.
In '4' Propontis, as '458' as I '51' '819', '697' of '7' peculiar substance c'34'ed brit is to be '295', '4' ali'508't of '4' '40' whale. But I '19' e'131' '385' to '172' '7' '4' '696' of '4' sperm whale—squid or '537'tle-fish—lurks at '4' bottom of '7' sea, beca'364' large cr'545'ures, '33' by no '410' '4' largest of '7' '563', '19' '91' '295' at '716' sur'352'.

Though, consumed '31' '4' '576' '522' of '90' purpose, Ahab in '34' '90' '147's '6' '735'ions '167' '97' in view '4' ultimate capture of Moby Dick; '463' he '562'ed '325' to sacrif'972' '34' mortal inte'426's to '7' '63' '962'ion; n'167''4''759' it '289' '19' '91' '7' he '28' by nature '6' '192' ha'437'uation '458' '111' wedded to a fiery whale'128''s '103's, alto'42''49' to ab'6'on '4' col'379'al prose'537'ion of '4' voyage. Or at '402' if '14' '85' '173'wise, t'43' '85' '23' '53'ing '173' motives '137' '117' influential '31' '58'. It '72' be refining '111' '137', '760', '140' con'500''847' '90' mono'128'ia, to hint '7' '90' vindictiveness to'869'ds '4' W'479'e Whale '240' '19' '999' ex'606'ded '716'elf in '96' degree to '34' sperm whales, '6' '7' '4' '117' monsters he slew by so '137' '4' '117' he multip'596'd '4' '365's '7' '356' subsequently en'893'e'796' whale '72' '831' to be '4' '413'd '63' he hunted. But if '375' an hypo'4'sis be indeed '722'ion'473', t'43' '85' s'773' additional con'500'rations '265', '463' '23' so strictly according '31' '4' wildness of '90' ruling '962'ion, '332' '85' by no '410' incap'473' of s'103'ing '58'.
To accomplish '90' object Ahab '259' '364' '111'ls; '6' of '34' '111'ls '364'd in '4' s'97'ow of '4' moon, '508' '36' '344' apt to '42' '44' of '619'. He k'212', '17' example, '7' '60''167' magnetic '90' asc'398'ency in '96' '952's '28' '118' Starbuck, '332' '7' asc'398'ency '64' '23' c'118' '4' comp'123'e spiritual '128' '138' '117' '169' mere corpo'272' superiority involves in'81'ectual mastership; '17' to '4' purely spiritual, '4' in'81'ectual '33' st'6' in a '563' of corpo'272' relation. Starbuck's '618' '6' Starbuck's coerced '76' '85' Ahab's, so '192' as Ahab '764' '90' magnet at Starbuck's brain; s'773' he k'212' '7' '17' '34' '14' '4' chief mate, in '90' soul, abhor'796' '90' captain's quest, '6' '87' he, '72' joy'597'y disintegrate '58''968' '83' it, or '140' frustrate it. It '240' be '7' a '192' interval '72' elapse ere '4' W'479'e Whale '28' '333'. Du'847' '7' '192' interval Starbuck '72' '167' be apt to f'34' '155' '422' relapses of rebellion '485' '90' captain's leadership, un'759' '96' ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences '85' '561' to bear upon '58'. Not '146' '7', '33' '4' subtle insanity of Ahab '952'ing Moby Dick '28' '56'ays '117' '659'ifi'51'tly '128'ifested '169' in '90' superlative '587' '6' shrewdness in '17'e'66'ing '7', '17' '4' '986', '4' hunt '134' in '96' '103' be s'798'ped of '7' st'868'ge imaginative impiousness '265' natur'34'y invested it; '7' '4' '597' terror of '4' voyage '259' be '764' '31'drawn '155' '4' obscure '78'ground ('17' '360' '508''s c'119'age is proof '485' protr'735'ed meditation unre'596'ved by '735'ion); '7' '74' '69' s'111'd '238' '192' '168' '430'es, '90' '493'rs '6' '508' '259' '19' '96' '958'er '124's to '54' of '169' Moby Dick. For '60''167' eagerly '6' impetuously '4' savage crew '97' hailed '4' announce'508't of '90' quest; '332' '34' sailors of '34' '563's '36' '117' or '759' capricious '6' unreli'473'—'69' '349' in '4' varying '44'er wea'4'r, '6' '69' inhale '716' fickleness—'6' '74' retained '17' '138' object remote '6' blank in '4' pursuit, '60''167' pro'376'ory of '139' '6' '962'ion in '4' '398', it is above '34' '124's requi'421'e '7' temporary inte'426's '6' employ'508'ts '134' intervene '6' '330' '116' healthily susp'398'ed '17' '4' final dash.
Nor '28' Ahab un'241'ful of an'173' '124'. In '464' of '777' emotion '128''207' disdain '34' base con'500'rations; '33' '375' '464' '36' evanescent. The per'128'ent constitutional condition of '4' '128'u'418'u'796' '128', '147' Ahab, is sor'64'ness. G'868'ting '7' '4' W'479'e Whale '597'y incites '4' '374's of '14' my savage crew, '6' '657' round '238' savageness '140' breeds a '979' generous k'168'-er'868'tism in '116', s'773', '313' '17' '4' '112' of it '69' '145' c'129'e to Moby Dick, '69' '259' '516' '19' '696' '17' '238' '117' common, daily appetites. For '140' '4' '530' lifted '6' chivalric Crusaders of '261' '464' '85' '23' con'606't to traverse '149' thous'6' miles of l'6' to '535' '17' '238' holy sepulchre, '327' committing burglaries, '512'ing pockets, '6' gaining '173' pious perqui'421'es by '4' '103'. Had '69' '91' strictly held to '238' '63' final '6' ro'128'tic object—'7' final '6' ro'128'tic object, '111' '128'y '72' '19' '391'ed '83' in disgust. I '76' '23' s'798' '182' '508', '147' Ahab, of '34' '274's of cash—aye, cash. T'84' '289' scorn cash '56'; '33' '123' '96' '611' go by, '6' no perspective '449' of it to '116', '6' '98' '14' '276' quiescent cash '34' at '336' mutinying in '116', '14' '276' cash '72' '358' cashier Ahab.
Nor '28' t'43' '53'ing s'773' an'173' precautionary motive '117' re'399'd to Ahab '369''34'y. Having impulsively, it is prob'473', '6' '760' '96''11' prematurely revealed '4' prime '33' '988' purpose of '4' Pequod's voyage, Ahab '28' '56' '797'ly conscious '7', in so '143', he '97' indirectly laid '58''968' '422' to '4' un'491''473' charge of usurpation; '6' '31' '475' impunity, '312' moral '6' legal, '90' crew if so disposed, '6' to '7' '398' compe'606't, '87' ref'364' '34' fur'4'r obe'474'nce to '58', '6' '140' violently w'426' '83' '58' '4' com'128'd. From '140' '4' '960'ely hinted im'186'ation of usurpation, '6' '4' '622' consequences of '375' a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab '259' of '239' '19' '91' '344' anxious to '711' '58''968'. That '711'ion '87' '146' consist in '90' '249' p'796'ominating brain '6' '374' '6' h'6', '78'ed by a heedful, '452'ly calculating at'606'tion to e'131' '294' atmosp'49'ic influence '265' it '28' '622' '17' '90' crew to be subjected to.
For '34' '182' '385's '98', '6' '173's '760' '111' analytic to be verb'34'y developed '43', Ahab plainly '282' '7' he '259' s'773' in a '68' degree continue '354' to '4' natural, nominal purpose of '4' Pequod's voyage; observe '34' customary usages; '6' '23' '146' '7', '33' '17'ce '58''968' to evince '34' '90' '35' '677' '962'ionate inte'426' in '4' general pursuit of '90' profession.

CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.

It '28' a cloudy, sul'244' '180'noon; '4' sea'508' '85' lazily lounging '39' '4' decks, or va'51'tly gazing '118' '155' '4' lead-col'119'ed '604's. Queequeg '6' I '85' mildly employed weaving '11' is c'34'ed a s'429'-mat, '17' an additional lashing to '119' boat. So s'773' '6' subdued '6' '332' '96''60' preluding '28' '34' '4' scene, '6' '375' an in'51'tation of r'167'ie lurked in '4' '769', '7' '356' silent sailor '562'ed resolved '155' '90' '249' invisible '968'.
I '28' '4' at'606'dant or page of Queequeg, '313' '748' at '4' mat. As I '764' '962'ing '6' re'962'ing '4' filling or woof of mar'518' '592'ween '4' '192' yarns of '4' '869'p, '970' my '249' h'6' '17' '4' '472'tle, '6' as Queequeg, st'6'ing '500''103's, '167' '6' anon slid '90' heavy oaken s'429' '592'ween '4' th'504's, '6' idly '262' '141' upon '4' '604', '324'e'759'ly '6' un'54'ingly drove '179' e'131' yarn: I '99' so st'868'ge a '710'iness '64' t'43' '98' reign '34' '118' '4' ship '6' '34' '118' '4' sea, '146' '785'n by '4' intermitting dull '602' of '4' s'429', '7' it '562'ed as if '14' '85' '4' Loom of Time, '6' I '302' '85' a '472'tle mechanic'34'y weaving '6' weaving '170' at '4' Fates. T'43' lay '4' '950'ed th'504's of '4' '869'p subject to '33' '63' single, '167' re'391'ing, unc'621'ing vibration, '6' '7' vibration merely '243' to '774' of '4' crosswise interbl'398'ing of '173' th'504's '31' '716' '249'. T'90' '869'p '562'ed neces'421'y; '6' '43', '147' I, '31' my '249' h'6' I ply my '249' '472'tle '6' weave my '249' destiny '155' '182' unalter'473' th'504's. Mean'75', Queequeg's impulsive, in'465' s'429', so'559'imes '479'ting '4' woof slantingly, or crookedly, or '777'ly, or weakly, as '4' '390' '240' be; '6' by '14' difference in '4' concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in '4' final aspect of '4' comp'123'ed fabric; '14' savage's s'429', '147' I, '265' thus fin'34'y shapes '6' fashions '312' '869'p '6' woof; '14' '454', in'465' s'429' '259' be '365'—aye, '365', '523' '76', '6' neces'421'y—'56'ise incompatible—'34' interweavingly '406' to'42''49'. The '688' '869'p of neces'421'y, '23' to be swerved '83' '716' ultimate '239'—'716' e'131' alternating vibration, indeed, '146' '606'ding to '7'; '523' '76' s'773' '523' to ply '49' '472'tle '592'ween '145'n th'504's; '6' '365', '463' '426'rained in '716' '412' '31'in '4' '40' '518's of neces'421'y, '6' '500''103's in '716' motions directed by '523' '76', '463' thus prescri'515' to by '312', '365' by '391's rules ei'4'r, '6' '129' '4' '181' f'545'u'847' blow at '140'ts.
Thus we '85' weaving '6' weaving '170' '74' I '319'ed at a '602' so st'868'ge, '192' drawn, '6' '886''34'y wild '6' un'987'ly, '7' '4' b'34' of '523' '76' '705'ped '83' my h'6', '6' I s'111'd gazing up at '4' clouds '74'ce '7' '915' '705'ped '46' a '768'g. High aloft in '4' cross-trees '28' '7' '721' Gay-Header, Tashtego. His '618' '28' r'356'ing eagerly '17''869'd, '90' h'6' stretched '44' '46' a w'6', '6' at brief sudden intervals he continued '90' cries. To be '115' '4' '276' '602' '28' '7' '131' mo'508't '760' '213' '299' '34' '118' '4' seas, '83' hund'796's of whale'508''s '73'-'44's perched as '530' in '4' '769'; '33' '83' '360' of '200' lungs '87' '7' accustomed '261' cry '19' derived '375' a marvellous cadence as '83' Tashtego '4' Indian's.
As he s'111'd h'118'ing '118' '1' '499' susp'398'ed in '769', so wildly '6' eagerly pee'847' to'869'ds '4' horizon, '1' '72' '19' '147' '58' '96' prophet or '66'r be'956' '4' s'97'ows of Fate, '6' by '200' wild cries announcing '238' '260'.
"T'43' '50' blows! t'43'! t'43'! t'43'! '50' blows! '50' blows!"
"W'43'-'170'?"
"On '4' lee-beam, '39' '149' miles '141'! a '351' of '116'!"
Instantly '34' '28' commotion.
The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, '31' '4' '276' undeviating '6' reli'473' uni'17'mity. And t'43'by whale'508' distinguish '14' fish '83' '173' tribes of '90' genus.
"T'43' go flukes!" '28' '56' '4' cry '83' Tashtego; '6' '4' whales disappea'796'.
"Quick, ste'869'd!" cried Ahab. "Time! '75'!"
Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at '4' '430', '6' reported '4' ex'735' '294' to Ahab.
The ship '28' '56' '764' '170' '83' '4' '768'd, '6' '50' '277' gently rolling '165' it. Tashtego reporting '7' '4' whales '97' g'63' d'249' '342'ing to lee'869'd, we confidently '720' to '66' '116' '158' directly in advance of '119' bows. For '7' singular craft at '464' evinced by '4' Sperm Whale '74', '602'ing '31' '90' '342' in '63' direction, he n'167''4''759', '313' c'336'aled ben'545'h '4' sur'352', mills round, '6' swiftly swims '141' in '4' oppo'421'e quarter—'14' deceitfulness of '90' '87' '23' '56' be in '735'ion; '17' t'43' '28' no '385' to '803' '7' '4' fish '333' by Tashtego '97' '91' in '138' '103' alarmed, or indeed k'212' at '34' of '119' vicinity. One of '4' '508' selected '17' ship'184'ers—'7' is, '200' '23' ap'378'ed to '4' boats, by '14' '75' re'596'ved '4' Indian at '4' main-mast '342'. The sailors at '4' '17'e '6' mizzen '97' '67' d'249'; '4' '518' tubs '85' '950'ed in '238' '226's; '4' c'868'es '85' thrust '44'; '4' mainyard '28' '78'ed, '6' '4' '291' boats swung '118' '4' sea '46' '291' samphire b'257'ets '118' '530' cliffs. Out'500' of '4' bul'869'ks '238' eager crews '31' '63' h'6' clung to '4' rail, '313' '63' foot '28' '741'antly poised on '4' '723'wale. So '73' '4' '192' '518' of '128'-of-'869''s '508' '39' to '687' '116'selves on board an enemy's ship.
But at '14' critical instant a sudden exclamation '28' '299' '7' '111'k e'131' '784' '83' '4' whale. With a '319' '34' gla'796' at '967' Ahab, '94' '28' surrounded by '401' dusky phantoms '7' '562'ed fresh '17'med '44' of '769'.




CHAPTER 48. The First L'969''847'.

The phantoms, '17' so '69' '98' '562'ed, '85' flitting on '4' '173' '500' of '4' deck, '6', '31' a noise'759' celerity, '85' casting loose '4' tackles '6' b'6's of '4' boat '265' swung t'43'. T'90' boat '97' '194' '91' deemed '63' of '4' sp'36' boats, '463' technic'34'y c'34'ed '4' captain's, on ac'893' of '716' '621'ing '83' '4' starboard quarter. The '575' '7' '56' s'111'd by '716' bows '28' t'34' '6' s'869't, '31' '63' '691' '111'th '779'ly protruding '83' '716' steel-'46' lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of '751' cotton '427'ere'34'y invested '58', '31' wide '751' trowsers of '4' '276' '967' '343'. But st'868'gely cr'249'ing '14' ebonness '28' a g'919'ening '691' plaited turban, '4' '565' h'769' braided '6' coiled round '6' round upon '90' '342'. Less s'869't in aspect, '4' companions of '14' '575' '85' of '7' vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to '96' of '4' aboriginal natives of '4' Manillas;—a race '23'orious '17' a '979' diabolism of subtilty, '6' by '96' h'913't '691' mariners '340' to be '4' paid spies '6' '669' confidential agents on '4' '604' of '4' d'779', '238' lord, '94'se '893'ing-'267' '69' '803' to be '234'w'43'.
While '332' '4' '909' ship's '624' '85' gazing upon '182' st'868'gers, Ahab cried '44' to '4' '691'-turbaned '261' '128' at '238' '342', "All '325' t'43', Fed'34'ah?"
"Ready," '28' '4' '499'-'90'sed reply.
"L'969'r '170' '98'; d'ye '230'?" sh'44'ing across '4' deck. "L'969'r '170' t'43', I '99'."
Such '28' '4' th'447' of '90' '915', '7' spite of '238' amaze'508't '4' '508' sp'868'g '118' '4' rail; '4' '50'aves whirled round in '4' blocks; '31' a w'34'ow, '4' '291' boats '705'ped '155' '4' sea; '313', '31' a dexterous, '141'-h'6'ed da'847', un'677' in '138' '173' vocation, '4' sailors, goat-'46', leaped d'249' '4' rolling ship's '500' '155' '4' tossed boats below.
Hardly '97' '69' '732'ed '44' '83' '447' '4' ship's lee, '74' a '492'th keel, '260' '83' '4' '768'd'869'd '500', '732'ed round '447' '4' stern, '6' s'60'ed '4' '401' st'868'gers ro'768'g Ahab, '94', st'6'ing erect in '4' stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, '6' Fl'257', to sp'504' '116'selves widely, so as to c'118' a large expanse of '604'. But '31' '34' '238' '495' '158' riveted upon '4' s'869't Fed'34'ah '6' '90' crew, '4' inmates of '4' '173' boats ob'784'd '23' '4' com'128'd.
"Captain Ahab?—" '136' Starbuck.
"Sp'504' y'119'selves," cried Ahab; "'145' '103', '34' '492' boats. Thou, Fl'257', '732' '44' '117' to lee'869'd!"
"Aye, aye, '284'," cheerily cried '105' King-Post, sweeping round '90' '164' stee'847' oar. "Lay '78'!" ad'926'ing '90' crew. "T'43'!—t'43'!—t'43' '158'! T'43' '50' blows '40' '531', '311's!—lay '78'!"
"N'167' heed yonder yellow '311's, Archy."
"Oh, I '21' '241''514', '284'," '136' Archy; "I k'212' it '34' '165' '56'. Didn't I '230' '514' in '4' '330'? And '64'n't I '81' Cabaco '43' of it? What '99' ye, Cabaco? T'84' '36' stow'170's, '197' Fl'257'."
"Pull, '732', my '178' '374's-a'349'; '732', my '566'; '732', my '105' '913'," drawlingly '6' soo'124'ly sighed Stubb to '90' crew, '96' of '94'm s'773' s'60'ed '659's of uneasiness. "Why '21' '1' '448' y'119' '78'b'913', my '311's? What is it '1' st'36' at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! T'84' '36' '146' '401' '117' '524' '67' to '148' us—n'167' '241' '83' w'43'—'4' '117' '4' merrier. Pull, '98', do '732'; n'167' '241' '4' brimst'63'—d'779's '36' '68' '947'ows '243'. So, so; t'43' '1' '36' '56'; '55' '4' stroke '17' a thous'6' pounds; '55' '4' stroke to sweep '4' s'726'! Hurrah '17' '4' g'261' cup of sperm oil, my '49'oes! Three cheers, '508'—'34' '374's a'349'! Easy, '454'; '21' be in a '906'—'21' be in a '906'. Why '21' '1' snap y'119' oars, '1' rascals? Bite so'559'hing, '1' '766's! So, so, so, '98':—softly, softly! That's it—'55' it! '192' '6' '777'. Give '103' t'43', '145' '103'! The d'779' fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapsc'34'ions; ye '36' '34' a'503'. S'739' sno'847', ye '503'ers, '6' '732'. Pull, '76' ye? '732', '51''t ye? '732', '205' ye? Why in '4' '275' of gudgeons '6' ginger-cakes '21' ye '732'?—'732' '6' '448' so'559'hing! '732', '6' '319' y'119' '495' '44'!

Now ye do so'559'hing; '7' '388' '46' it, my steel-b'716'. Start '49'—'319' '49', my silver-spoons! Start '49', marling-spikes!"
Stubb's exordium to '90' crew is '145'n '43' at large, beca'364' he '97' '743' a peculiar '103' of '150'ing to '116' in general, '6' especi'34'y in inculcating '4' religion of ro'768'g. But '1' '259' '23' '803' '83' '14' speci'508' of '90' sermonizings '7' he '167' flew '155' d'249''40' '962'ions '31' '90' congregation. Not at '34'; '6' t'43'in consisted '90' chief peculiarity. He '72' '99' '4' '344' terrific '124's to '90' crew, in a t'63' so st'868'gely compounded of '427' '6' fury, '6' '4' fury '562'ed so calcu'399'd merely as a sp'972' to '4' '427', '7' no oars'128' '87' '230' '375' queer invocations '327' '732'ing '17' '599' '139', '6' '332' '732'ing '17' '4' mere joke of '4' '124'. Be'500's he '34' '4' '75' '720' so '454' '6' indolent '58''968', so loungingly '128'aged '90' stee'847'-oar, '6' so b'937'ly gaped—'422'-'843'ed at '464'—'7' '4' mere sight of '375' a yawning com'128'der, by '50'er '17'ce of contrast, '735'ed '46' a charm upon '4' crew. Then '158', Stubb '28' '63' of '200' odd '563' of humorists, '94'se jollity is so'559'imes so curiously am'201'uous, as to '186' '34' inferiors on '238' guard in '4' '301' of obeying '116'.
In obe'474'nce to a '659' '83' Ahab, Starbuck '28' '56' '732'ing obliquely across Stubb's bow; '6' '74' '17' a '294' or so '4' '149' boats '85' '281' '958' to '356' '173', Stubb hailed '4' mate.
"'197' Starbuck! larboard boat t'43', ahoy! a '429' '31' ye, '284', if ye '142'!"
"H'34'oa!" re'391'ed Starbuck, '391'ing round '23' a single inch as he spoke; s'773' earnestly '33' w'90'pe'847'ly urging '90' crew; '90' '352' '451' '46' a flint '83' Stubb's.
"What '54' ye of '200' yellow '311's, '284'!
"Smuggled on board, '96''60', '165' '4' ship sailed. (Strong, '777', '311's!)" in a w'90'per to '90' crew, '98' '613'ing '44' loud '158': "A sad '355', '197' Stubb! ('66''4' '49', '66''4' '49', my lads!) '33' n'167' '241', '197' Stubb, '34' '17' '4' '258'. Let '34' y'119' crew '732' '777', '67' '11' '76'. (Sp'847', my '508', sp'847'!)

"Aye, aye, I '147' as '137'," soliloquized Stubb, '74' '4' boats diverged, "as '358' as I clapt '784' on '514', I '147' so. Aye, '6' '55' '11' he '277' '155' '4' '180' '330' '17', so of'606', as Dough-Boy '192' suspected. T'84' '85' hidden d'249' t'43'. The W'479'e Whale's at '4' bottom of it. Well, '35', so be it! Can't be '148'ed! All '40'! Give '103', '508'! It '594' '4' W'479'e Whale to-'183'! Give '103'!"
Now '4' advent of '182' '44'l'6'ish st'868'gers at '375' a critical instant as '4' l'969''847' of '4' boats '83' '4' deck, '14' '97' '23' un'385'ably a'830'ned a '563' of superstitious amaze'508't in '96' of '4' ship's '624'; '33' Archy's fancied disco'131' '305' '96' '75' previous '61' ab'937' among '116', '463' indeed '23' c'796'ited '98', '14' '97' in '96' sm'34' mea'115' prepa'796' '116' '17' '4' '140't. It '111'k '141' '4' extreme edge of '238' '683'; '6' so '11' '31' '34' '14' '6' Stubb's confident '103' of ac'893'ing '17' '238' appea'868'ce, '69' '85' '17' '4' '75' '523'd '83' superstitious surmisings; '463' '4' af'807' s'773' '269' abundant '267' '17' '34' '128'ner of wild conjectures as to '967' Ahab's precise agency in '4' '301' '83' '4' beginning. For me, I silently rec'34'ed '4' mysterious s'97'ows I '97' '333' creeping on board '4' Pequod du'847' '4' dim Nantucket dawn, as '35' as '4' enigmatical hintings of '4' unac'893''473' Elijah.
Mean'75', Ahab, '44' of hea'847' of '90' '493'rs, '305' '500'd '4' fur'4'st to '768'd'869'd, '28' s'773' '868'ging '531' of '4' '173' boats; a circumstance be'613'ing '60' po'606't a crew '28' '732'ing '58'. Those tiger yellow cr'545'ures of '90' '562'ed '34' steel '6' whaleb'63'; '46' '401' '798'-hammers '69' rose '6' '947' '31' regular strokes of strength, '265' periodic'34'y '319'ed '4' boat '549' '4' '604' '46' a horizontal burst boiler '44' of a Mississippi s'851'er. As '17' Fed'34'ah, '94' '28' '333' '732'ing '4' harpo'63'er oar, he '97' '687'n a'500' '90' '751' jacket, '6' dis'412'ed '90' naked chest '31' '4' '251' '348' of '90' '618' above '4' '723'wale, '574'ly '537' '485' '4' alternating depressions of '4' '604'y horizon; '313' at '4' '173' '398' of '4' boat Ahab, '31' '63' arm, '46' a fencer's, '687'n '499' '78''869'd '155' '4' '769', as if to '893'erbalance '138' '606'dency to '798'; Ahab '28' '333' steadily '128'aging '90' stee'847' oar as in a thous'6' boat l'969''847's ere '4' W'479'e Whale '97' torn '58'. All at '336' '4' '44'stretched arm '417' a peculiar motion '6' '98' remained '950'ed, '313' '4' boat's '401' oars '85' '333' simultaneously peaked. Boat '6' crew sat motion'759' on '4' sea. Instantly '4' '291' sp'504' boats in '4' rear pa'364'd on '238' '103'. The whales '97' irregularly '451'tled bodily d'249' '155' '4' blue, thus '631' no distantly discernible token of '4' '367''508't, '463' '83' '90' '452'r vicinity Ahab '97' observed it.
"E'131' '128' '73' '44' '549' '90' oars!" cried Starbuck. "Thou, Queequeg, st'6' up!"
Nimbly sp'847'ing up on '4' triangular raised '990' in '4' bow, '4' savage s'111'd erect t'43', '6' '31' in'606'sely eager '495' gazed '141' to'869'ds '4' spot w'43' '4' c'129'e '97' '181' '91' descried. Likewise upon '4' extreme stern of '4' boat w'43' it '28' '516' triangularly plat'17'med level '31' '4' '723'wale, Starbuck '58''968' '28' '333' '494'ly '6' adroitly balancing '58''968' to '4' jerking tossings of '90' chip of a craft, '6' silently '784'ing '4' vast blue '784' of '4' sea.
Not '131' '458' distant Fl'257''s boat '28' '516' '666' br'545'h'759'ly s'773'; '716' com'128'der reck'759'ly st'6'ing upon '4' '739' of '4' logger'342', a st'44' '563' of post rooted in '4' keel, '6' rising '96' '149' '908' above '4' level of '4' stern plat'17'm. It is '364'd '17' '756'ing '391's '31' '4' whale '518'. Its '739' is '23' '117' spacious '169' '4' palm of a '128''s h'6', '6' st'6'ing upon '375' a base as '7', Fl'257' '562'ed perched at '4' mast-'342' of '96' ship '265' '97' sunk to '34' '33' '49' trucks. But '105' King-Post '28' sm'34' '6' '940', '6' at '4' '276' '75' '105' King-Post '28' '597' of a large '6' t'34' am'437'ion, so '7' '14' logger'342' st'6'-'378' of '90' '64' by no '410' satisfy King-Post.
"I '51''t '66' '291' seas '141'; tip us up an oar t'43', '6' '123' me on to '7'."
Upon '14', Daggoo, '31' ei'4'r h'6' upon '4' '723'wale to steady '90' '103', swiftly slid aft, '6' '98' erecting '58''968' voluntee'796' '90' lofty '134'ers '17' a pedestal.
"Good a mast-'342' as '138', '284'. Will '1' mount?"
"That I '76', '6' '144' ye '131' '137', my '178' '947'ow; '146' I '392' '1' fifty '908' t'34'er."
W'43'upon '519'ting '90' '908' firmly '485' '149' oppo'421'e '519'ks of '4' boat, '4' gigantic negro, s'111'ping a '105', '986'ed '90' flat palm to Fl'257''s foot, '6' '98' '966' Fl'257''s h'6' on '90' '230'se-plumed '342' '6' bidding '58' sp'847' as he '58''968' '134' toss, '31' '63' dexterous fling l'6'ed '4' '105' '128' '530' '6' dry on '90' '134'ers. And '43' '28' Fl'257' '56' st'6'ing, Daggoo '31' '63' lifted arm furnishing '58' '31' a breastb'6' to lean '485' '6' steady '58''968' by.
At '138' '75' it is a st'868'ge sight to '4' tyro to '66' '31' '11' wondrous ha'437'ude of unconscious s'320' '4' whale'128' '76' maintain an erect posture in '90' boat, '140' '74' pitched '39' by '4' '344' riotously perverse '6' cross-'573' seas. S'773' '117' st'868'ge to '66' '58' giddily perched upon '4' logger'342' '716'elf, '447' '375' circumstances. But '4' sight of '105' Fl'257' mounted upon gigantic Daggoo '28' '332' '117' curious; '17' sustaining '58''968' '31' a '494', in'465', '454', un'147' of, '960''960'ic majesty, '4' noble negro to e'131' roll of '4' sea harmoniously rolled '90' '178' '17'm. On '90' b'937' '78', flaxen-hai'796' Fl'257' '562'ed a s'56'-flake. The be'36'r '720' nobler '169' '4' '852'r. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, os'606'tatious '105' Fl'257' '72' '56' '6' '98' stamp '31' impatience; '33' '23' '63' added heave '64' he t'43'by '145' to '4' negro's lordly chest. So '19' I '333' P'652'ion '6' Vanity stamping '4' '565' magnanimous '987', '33' '4' '987' '64' '23' alter '49' tides '6' '49' sea'273's '17' '7'.
Mean'313' Stubb, '4' third mate, '592'rayed no '375' '458'-gazing solicitudes. The whales '240' '19' '721'e '63' of '238' regular '602'ings, '23' a temporary dive '83' mere f'40'; '6' if '7' '85' '4' '390', Stubb, as '90' wont in '375' '390's, it '562's, '28' resolved to solace '4' languishing interval '31' '90' pipe. He '31'drew it '83' '90' hatb'6', w'43' he '194' wore it aslant '46' a fea'4'r. He loaded it, '6' rammed '179' '4' loading '31' '90' thumb-'398'; '33' '321'ly '97' he ignited '90' match across '4' rough s'6''888' of '90' h'6', '74' Tashtego, '90' harpo'63'er, '94'se '495' '97' '91' '451'ting to '768'd'869'd '46' '149' '950'ed stars, suddenly '705'ped '46' '703' '83' '90' erect attitude to '90' s'545', crying '44' in a quick phrensy of '906', "D'249', d'249' '34', '6' '145' '103'!—t'43' '69' '36'!"
To a l'6's'128', no whale, nor '138' '659' of a '49''847', '72' '19' '91' visible at '7' mo'508't; no'124' '33' a '461'd '437' of greenish '691' '604', '6' thin scatte'796' puffs of vap'119' h'118'ing '118' it, '6' suff'970'ly blo'768'g '141' to lee'869'd, '46' '4' conf'364'd scud '83' '691' rolling '899'ows. The '769' '187' suddenly vibrated '6' tingled, as it '85', '46' '4' '769' '118' in'606'sely h'545'ed p'399's of iron.

Seen in advance of '34' '4' '173' indications, '4' puffs of vap'119' '69' sp'44'ed, '562'ed '238' '17'e'573' c'119'iers '6' detached f'666' '44''852'rs.
All '492' boats '85' '56' in keen pursuit of '7' '63' spot of '461'd '604' '6' '769'. But it '217'e '807' to '44's'798' '116'; it flew on '6' on, as a m'652' of interbl'398'ing bubbles borne d'249' a rapid stream '83' '4' hills.
"Pull, '732', my '68' '311's," '136' Starbuck, in '4' l'969'st '622' '33' in'606'sest c'336'ntrated w'90'per to '90' '508'; '313' '4' sharp '950'ed glance '83' '90' '495' darted '688' '531' of '4' bow, al'344' '562'ed as '149' visible '107'les in '149' uner'847' binnacle com'962'es. He '64' '23' '99' '137' to '90' crew, '463', nor '64' '90' crew '99' '138''124' to '58'. Only '4' silence of '4' boat '28' at intervals '319'lingly pierced by '63' of '90' peculiar w'90'pers, '56' harsh '31' com'128'd, '56' soft '31' entr'545'y.
How '465' '4' loud '105' King-Post. "Sing '44' '6' '99' so'559'hing, my '374'ies. Roar '6' '732', my th'447'bolts!

O Lord, Lord! '33' I sh'34' go stark, sta'847' '721'! See! '66' '7' '691' '604'!" And so sh'44'ing, he '732'ed '90' hat '83' '90' '342', '6' stamped up '6' d'249' on it; '98' '512'ing it up, flirted it '458' '141' upon '4' sea; '6' fin'34'y '947' to rea'847' '6' plunging in '4' boat's stern '46' a crazed colt '83' '4' pr'769'ie.
"Look at '7' chap '56'," philosophic'34'y drawled Stubb, '94', '31' '90' un'703'ed '940' pipe, mechanic'34'y retained '592'ween '90' teeth, at a '940' distance, '858'ed '180'—"He's '61' f'716', '7' Fl'257' '129'.

But '11' it '28' '7' inscrut'473' Ahab '136' to '7' tiger-yellow crew of '90'—'182' '85' '429's '258' omitted '43'; '17' '1' '349' '447' '4' b'759'ed '703' of '4' evangelical l'6'. Only '4' infidel sharks in '4' audacious seas '289' '145' ear to '375' '429's, '74', '31' tornado brow, '6' '495' of '796' '776', '6' foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped '180' '90' prey.
Mean'313', '34' '4' boats tore on. The rep'545'ed specific '34'usions of Fl'257' to "'7' whale," as he c'34'ed '4' fictitious monster '265' he decla'796' to be incessantly tantalizing '90' boat's bow '31' '716' tail—'182' '34'usions of '90' '85' at '464' so vivid '6' '139'-'46', '7' '69' '72' ca'364' '96' '63' or '149' of '90' '508' to snatch a fearful '73' '118' '4' '134'er. But '14' '28' '485' '34' rule; '17' '4' oars'508' '259' '186' '44' '238' '495', '6' ram a skewer '209' '238' necks; usage pronouncing '7' '69' '259' '19' no organs '33' ears, '6' no limbs '33' arms, in '182' critical mo'508'ts.
It '28' a sight '597' of quick '683' '6' awe! The vast s'35's of '4' omnipo'606't sea; '4' surging, hollow roar '69' '721'e, as '69' rolled '549' '4' '879' '723'wales, '46' gigantic bowls in a bound'759' bowling-green; '4' brief susp'398'ed '414'ny of '4' boat, as it '72' tip '17' an instant on '4' knife-'46' edge of '4' sharper waves, '7' al'344' '562'ed threa'606'ing to '537' it in '149'; '4' sudden pro'295' dip '155' '4' '604'y glens '6' hollows; '4' keen spur'847's '6' goadings to gain '4' '739' of '4' oppo'421'e hill; '4' '342''192', sled-'46' slide d'249' '716' '173' '500';—'34' '182', '31' '4' cries of '4' '342's'508' '6' harpo'63'ers, '6' '4' shudde'847' gasps of '4' oars'508', '31' '4' wondrous sight of '4' ivory Pequod bea'847' d'249' upon '49' boats '31' '44'stretched sails, '46' a wild hen '180' '49' screaming brood;—'34' '14' '28' thrilling.
Not '4' raw recruit, marching '83' '4' bosom of '90' '362' '155' '4' f'167' h'545' of '90' '171' battle; '23' '4' '314' '128''s ghost en'893'e'847' '4' '171' un'677' phantom in '4' '173' '296';—'948' of '182' '51' '174' st'868'ger '6' '777'er emotions '169' '7' '128' '185', '94' '17' '4' '171' '75' '156's '58''968' '732'ing '155' '4' charmed, churned circle of '4' hunted sperm whale.
The dancing '691' '604' '721'e by '4' c'129'e '28' '56' be'260' '117' '6' '117' visible, o'768'g to '4' increasing '967'ness of '4' dun cloud-s'97'ows flung upon '4' sea. The jets of vap'119' no '192'er bl'398'ed, '33' tilted e'131'w'43' to '40' '6' '269'; '4' whales '562'ed separating '238' '830's. The boats '85' '732'ed '117' a'348'; Starbuck '631' c'129'e to '291' whales '573' '314' to lee'869'd. Our sail '28' '56' '451', '6', '31' '4' s'773' rising '768'd, we ru'50'd '549'; '4' boat '45' '31' '375' '721'ness '209' '4' '604', '7' '4' lee oars '87' s'324'cely be '176'ed rapidly '243' to escape '213' torn '83' '4' row-locks.
Soon we '85' '573' '209' a suff'970' wide veil of mist; '948' ship nor boat to be '333'.
"Give '103', '508'," w'90'pe'796' Starbuck, dra'768'g s'773' fur'4'r aft '4' '50'et of '90' sail; "t'43' is '75' to '320' a fish '332' '165' '4' squ'34' '67's. T'43''s '691' '604' '158'!—'452' to! Sp'847'!"
Soon '180', '149' cries in quick succession on '356' '500' of us de'23'ed '7' '4' '173' boats '97' '61' '692'; '33' '321'ly '85' '69' '118''299', '74' '31' a '703'ning-'46' '310'ling w'90'per Starbuck '136': "St'6' up!" '6' Queequeg, harpoon in h'6', sp'868'g to '90' '908'.
Though '23' '63' of '4' oars'508' '28' '98' facing '4' '139' '6' '548' peril so '452' to '116' '531', '332' '31' '238' '495' on '4' in'606'se coun'606'ance of '4' mate in '4' stern of '4' boat, '69' k'212' '7' '4' im'462'nt instant '97' '67'; '69' '299', '111', an enormous w'34'o'768'g '602' as of fifty elephants stir'847' in '238' litter. Mean'313' '4' boat '28' s'773' booming '209' '4' mist, '4' waves curling '6' '90'sing '187' us '46' '4' erected c'426's of enraged serpents.
"That's '90' hump. T'43', t'43', '145' it to '58'!" w'90'pe'796' Starbuck.
A '940' rushing '602' leaped '44' of '4' boat; it '28' '4' darted iron of Queequeg. Then '34' in '63' welded commotion '246' an invisible push '83' astern, '313' '17''869'd '4' boat '562'ed striking on a ledge; '4' sail collapsed '6' exploded; a gush of scalding vap'119' s'576' up '958' by; so'559'hing rolled '6' tumbled '46' an '987'quake ben'545'h us. The '251' crew '85' '499' suffocated as '69' '85' tossed helter-skelter '155' '4' '691' curdling cream of '4' squ'34'. Squ'34', whale, '6' harpoon '97' '34' bl'398'ed to'42''49'; '6' '4' whale, merely grazed by '4' iron, escaped.
Though comp'123'ely swamped, '4' boat '28' '958'ly unharmed. Swimming round it we '512'ed up '4' floating oars, '6' lashing '116' across '4' '723'wale, tumbled '78' to '119' '226's. T'43' we sat up to '119' knees in '4' sea, '4' '604' c'118'ing e'131' rib '6' '519'k, so '7' to '119' d'249''869'd gazing '495' '4' susp'398'ed craft '562'ed a coral boat gr'249' up to us '83' '4' bottom of '4' ocean.
The '768'd increased to a '60'l; '4' waves da'50'd '238' bucklers to'42''49'; '4' '251' squ'34' roa'796', '17'ked, '6' crackled '187' us '46' a '691' '522' upon '4' pr'769'ie, in '265', unconsumed, we '85' burning; immortal in '182' jaws of '548'! In vain we hailed '4' '173' boats; as '35' roar to '4' '349' coals d'249' '4' c'58'ney of a flaming furnace as hail '200' boats in '7' storm. Mean'313' '4' driving scud, rack, '6' mist, grew '967'er '31' '4' s'97'ows of '168'; no '659' of '4' ship '87' be '333'. The rising sea '17''217'e '34' attempts to bale '44' '4' boat. The oars '85' '364''759' as propellers, per'17'ming '56' '4' '493' of '139'-preservers. So, '537'ting '4' lashing of '4' '604'proof match keg, '180' '128'y failures Starbuck contrived to ignite '4' lamp in '4' lantern; '98' stretching it on a waif pole, h'6'ed it to Queequeg as '4' st'6'ard-be'36'r of '14' '17'lorn '274'. T'43', '98', he sat, '956' up '7' imbecile '51'dle in '4' '374' of '7' al'240'y '17'lornness. T'43', '98', he sat, '4' '659' '6' symbol of a '128' '327' faith, '274''759'ly '956' up '274' in '4' midst of desp'769'.
Wet, drenched '209', '6' shive'847' '690', despai'847' of ship or boat, we lifted up '119' '495' as '4' dawn '246' on. The mist s'773' sp'504' '118' '4' sea, '4' empty lantern lay cru'50'd in '4' bottom of '4' boat. Suddenly Queequeg '319'ed to '90' '908', hollo'768'g '90' h'6' to '90' ear. We '34' '299' a faint creaking, as of ropes '6' yards '479''49'to muffled by '4' storm. The '602' '246' '958'er '6' '958'er; '4' thick mists '85' dimly '348'ed by a huge, vague '17'm. Aff'40'ed, we '34' sp'868'g '155' '4' sea as '4' ship at '181' loomed '155' view, bea'847' '40' d'249' upon us '31'in a distance of '23' '137' '117' '169' '716' length.
Floating on '4' waves we '282' '4' ab'6''63'd boat, as '17' '63' instant it tossed '6' gaped ben'545'h '4' ship's bows '46' a chip at '4' base of a catar'735'; '6' '98' '4' vast hull rolled '118' it, '6' it '28' '333' no '117' '773' it '246' up welte'847' astern. Again we swam '17' it, '85' da'50'd '485' it by '4' seas, '6' '85' at '181' '645' up '6' '564'ly l'6'ed on board. Ere '4' squ'34' '246' '452' to, '4' '173' boats '97' '537' loose '83' '238' fish '6' re'391'ed to '4' ship in '68' '75'. The ship '97' '145'n us up, '33' '28' s'773' cruising, if haply it '240' '703' upon '96' token of '119' perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.




CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.

T'43' '36' '979' queer '464' '6' occasions in '14' st'868'ge mixed af'807' we c'34' '139' '74' a '128' '726' '14' '251' universe '17' a vast pr'735'ical joke, '463' '4' wit t'43'of he '33' dimly discerns, '6' '117' '169' suspects '7' '4' joke is at no'618''s expense '33' '90' '249'. How'167', no'124' dispir'716', '6' no'124' '562's '736' '313' dis'186'ing. He bolts d'249' '34' '140'ts, '34' creeds, '6' be'596'fs, '6' persuasions, '34' '321' '124's visible '6' invisible, n'167' '241' '60' knobby; as an ostrich of po'606't digestion gobbles d'249' bul'123's '6' '723' flints. And as '17' sm'34' difficulties '6' '346'ings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of '139' '6' limb; '34' '182', '6' '548' '716'elf, '562' to '58' '146' sly, '68'-natu'796' '479's, '6' jolly punches in '4' '500' '258''969'd by '4' un'333' '6' unac'893''473' '261' joker. That odd '563' of '103''869'd mood I am '613'ing of, '67's '118' a '128' '146' in '96' '75' of extreme tribulation; it '67's in '4' '131' midst of '90' earnestness, so '7' '11' '22' '165' '240' '19' '562'ed to '58' a '124' '344' mo'508'tous, '56' '562's '33' a '348' of '4' general joke. T'43' is no'124' '46' '4' perils of whaling to breed '14' '523' '6' '454' '563' of genial, desperado philosophy; '6' '31' it I '56' regarded '14' '251' voyage of '4' Pequod, '6' '4' '164' W'479'e Whale '716' object.
"Queequeg," '136' I, '74' '69' '97' dragged me, '4' '181' '128', to '4' deck, '6' I '28' s'773' shaking '302' in my jacket to fling '141' '4' '604'; "Queequeg, my '178' fri'398', '185' '14' '563' of '124' of'606' '308'?" With'44' '137' emotion, '463' soaked '209' '22' '46' me, he '417' me to '447'st'6' '7' '375' '124's '64' of'606' '308'.

"Certain. '114' l'969''796' '17' whales '83' a leaking ship in a gale '141' Cape Horn."
"'197' Fl'257'," '136' I, '391'ing to '105' King-Post, '94' '28' st'6'ing '452' by; "'1' '36' experienced in '182' '124's, '6' I am '23'.

"Can't '1' twist '7' sm'34'er?" '136' Fl'257'. "Yes, '55' '4' '749'. I '134' '46' to '66' a boat's crew '78'ing '604' up to a whale '352' '17'e'344'. Ha, ha! '4' whale '72' '145' '116' squint '17' squint, '241' '7'!"
Here '98', '83' '291' im'348'ial witnesses, I '97' a deliberate '892''508't of '4' '797' '390'. Con'500''847', t'43''17'e, '7' squ'34's '6' capsizings in '4' '604' '6' consequent bivouacks on '4' deep, '85' '301's of common occurrence in '14' '207' of '139'; con'500''847' '7' at '4' superlatively critical instant of '45' on to '4' whale I '259' re'659' my '139' '155' '4' '524' of '58' '94' stee'796' '4' boat—of'606''464' a '947'ow '94' at '7' '131' mo'508't is in '90' impetuousness upon '4' '378' of s'537'tling '4' craft '31' '90' '249' f'868'tic stampings; con'500''847' '7' '4' '348'icular disaster to '119' '249' '348'icular boat '28' chiefly to be im'186'ed to Starbuck's driving on to '90' whale al'344' in '4' teeth of a squ'34', '6' con'500''847' '7' Starbuck, '23''31'st'6'ing, '28' famous '17' '90' '164' heedfulness in '4' fi'50'ry; con'500''847' '7' I be'192'ed to '14' uncomm'146' prudent Starbuck's boat; '6' fin'34'y con'500''847' in '11' a d'779''s c'129'e I '28' implicated, '678'ing '4' W'479'e Whale: '409' '34' '124's to'42''49', I '99', I '147' I '240' as '35' go below '6' '106' a rough draft of my '76'. "Queequeg," '136' I, "'67' '549', '1' sh'34' be my '977', exe'537'or, '6' legatee."
It '289' '562' st'868'ge '7' of '34' '508' sailors '134' be tinke'847' at '238' '181' '76's '6' '704'a'508'ts, '33' t'43' '36' no '151' in '4' '296' '117' fond of '7' diversion. T'90' '28' '4' '492'th '75' in my nautical '139' '7' I '97' d'63' '4' '276' '124'. After '4' ceremony '28' concluded upon '4' '986' occasion, I '577' '34' '4' easier; a st'63' '28' rolled '170' '83' my '374'. Be'500's, '34' '4' '433' I '134' '56' '349' '72' be as '68' as '4' '433' '7' Lazarus '349'd '180' '90' resurrection; a supple'508'tary '817' gain of so '128'y '611' or '731' as '4' '390' '240' be. I survived '302'; my '548' '6' burial '85' locked up in my chest.

Now '98', '147' I, unconsciously rolling up '4' sleeves of my frock, '43' '547' '17' a '494', collected dive at '548' '6' destruction, '6' '4' d'779' fetch '4' hind'344'.




CHAPTER 50. Ahab's Boat '6' Crew. Fed'34'ah.

"Who '72' '19' '147' it, Fl'257'!" cried Stubb; "if I '97' '33' '63' leg '1' '72' '23' '756' me in a boat, un'759' '126' to '188' '4' plug-hole '31' my timber toe. Oh! '86' a '533' '261' '128'!"
"I '21' '54' it so st'868'ge, '180' '34', on '7' ac'893'," '136' Fl'257'. "If '90' leg '85' '141' at '4' hip, '56', it '72' be a '465' '124'. That '72' dis'473' '58'; '33' he '129' '63' knee, '6' '68' '348' of '4' '173' '269', '1' k'56'."
"I '21' k'56' '7', my '105' '128'; I n'167' '332' '282' '58' kneel."
Among whale-wise '151' it '129' of'606' '91' argued whe'4'r, con'500''847' '4' paramount importance of '90' '139' to '4' success of '4' voyage, it is '40' '17' a whaling captain to jeopardize '7' '139' in '4' '735'ive perils of '4' c'129'e. So Tamerlane's sol'474'rs of'606' argued '31' tears in '238' '495', whe'4'r '7' invalu'473' '139' of '90' ought to be '324'ried '155' '4' thickest of '4' '535'.
But '31' Ahab '4' '455' '652'umed a modified aspect.

CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Sp'44'.

Days, '731' '962'ed, '6' '447' '454' sail, '4' ivory Pequod '97' slowly swept across '492' s'167'al cruising-grounds; '7' '141' '4' Azores; '141' '4' Cape de Verdes; on '4' P'399' (so c'34'ed), '213' '141' '4' '843' of '4' Rio de la Plata; '6' '4' Carrol Ground, an uns'101'd, '604'y locality, sou'4'rly '83' St. Helena.
It '28' '313' gliding '209' '182' latter '604's '7' '63' serene '6' moon'703' '168', '74' '34' '4' waves rolled by '46' scrolls of silver; '6', by '238' soft, suff'970' '66''124's, '721'e '11' '562'ed a sil'131' silence, '23' a solitude; on '375' a silent '168' a sil'131' jet '28' '333' '458' in advance of '4' '691' bubbles at '4' bow. Lit up by '4' moon, it '720' celestial; '562'ed '96' plumed '6' glitte'847' '152' uprising '83' '4' sea. Fed'34'ah '171' descried '14' jet. For of '182' moon'703' '168's, it '28' '90' wont to mount to '4' main-mast '342', '6' st'6' a '73'-'44' t'43', '31' '4' '276' precision as if it '97' '91' '183'. And '332', '463' '49'ds of whales '85' '333' by '168', '23' '63' whale'128' in a hund'796' '72' venture a l'969''847' '17' '116'. You '289' '54' '31' '11' emotions, '98', '4' sea'508' beheld '14' '261' Oriental perched aloft at '375' unusual '520'; '90' turban '6' '4' moon, companions in '63' sky. But '74', '180' sp'398'ing '90' uni'17'm interval t'43' '17' s'167'al successive '168's '327' utte'847' a single '602'; '74', '180' '34' '14' silence, '90' un'987'ly '915' '28' '299' announcing '7' sil'131', moon-lit jet, e'131' reclining mariner '319'ed to '90' '908' as if '96' '768'ged spirit '97' '703'ed in '4' rigging, '6' hailed '4' mortal crew. "T'43' '50' blows!" Had '4' trump of judg'508't bl'249', '69' '87' '23' '19' quive'796' '117'; '332' s'773' '69' '577' no terror; '743' plea'115'. For '463' it '28' a '344' unwonted '612', '332' so impressive '28' '4' cry, '6' so deliriously exciting, '7' al'344' e'131' soul on board instinctively de'284'ed a l'969''847'.
Walking '4' deck '31' quick, '500'-lunging st'852's, Ahab com'128'ded '4' t'g'34'ant sails '6' royals to be '451', '6' e'131' stunsail sp'504'. The '258' '128' in '4' ship '259' '101' '4' helm. Then, '31' e'131' mast-'342' '128'ned, '4' piled-up craft rolled d'249' '165' '4' '768'd. The st'868'ge, upheaving, lifting '606'dency of '4' taffrail breeze filling '4' hollows of so '128'y sails, '721'e '4' buoyant, h'118'ing deck to '174' '46' '769' ben'545'h '4' '908'; '313' s'773' '50' ru'50'd '549', as if '149' ant'414'nistic influences '85' struggling in '49'—'63' to mount direct to heaven, '4' '173' to '698' ya'768'gly to '96' horizontal goal. And '97' '1' '430'ed Ahab's '352' '7' '168', '1' '72' '19' '147' '7' in '58' '516' '149' '465' '124's '85' '869''847'. While '90' '63' '349' leg '721'e '349'ly echoes '549' '4' deck, e'131' stroke of '90' '314' limb '602'ed '46' a c'141'in-tap. On '139' '6' '548' '14' '261' '128' '459'ed. But '463' '4' ship so swiftly sped, '6' '463' '83' e'131' '784', '46' arrows, '4' eager glances s'576', '332' '4' sil'131' jet '28' no '117' '333' '7' '168'. E'131' sailor swore he '282' it '336', '33' '23' a '347' '75'.
T'90' mid'168'-sp'44' '97' al'344' gr'249' a '17''61''606' '124', '74', '96' '433' '180', lo! at '4' '276' silent '612', it '28' '158' announced: '158' it '28' descried by '34'; '33' upon '380' sail to '118''101' it, '336' '117' it disappea'796' as if it '97' n'167' '91'. And so it served us '168' '180' '168', '773' no '63' heeded it '33' to '683' at it. Mysteriously jetted '155' '4' '574' moon'703', or star'703', as '4' '390' '240' be; disappea'847' '158' '17' '63' '251' '183', or '149' '433', or '291'; '6' '96''60' '562'ing at e'131' distinct repetition to be advancing s'773' fur'4'r '6' fur'4'r in '119' van, '14' solitary jet '562'ed '17' '167' '34'u'847' us on.
Nor '31' '4' immemorial superstition of '238' race, '6' in accor'725' '31' '4' preternaturalness, as it '562'ed, '265' in '128'y '124's invested '4' Pequod, '85' t'43' '53'ing '96' of '4' sea'508' '94' swore '7' '74''167' '6' w'49''167' descried; at '60''167' remote '464', or in '60''167' '458' a'348' latitudes '6' '192'itudes, '7' un'958''473' sp'44' '28' cast by '63' '968'-'276' whale; '6' '7' whale, Moby Dick. For a '75', t'43' reigned, '111', a '587' of peculiar d'504' at '14' flitting apparition, as if it '85' tr'356'erously beckoning us on '6' on, in '619' '7' '4' monster '240' '391' round upon us, '6' r'398' us at '181' in '4' remo'704' '6' '344' savage seas.
These temporary apprehensions, so vague '33' so awful, derived a wondrous po'606'cy '83' '4' contrasting serenity of '4' wea'4'r, in '265', ben'545'h '34' '716' blue bl'6'ness, '96' '147' t'43' lurked a d'779'ish charm, as '17' '433' '6' '433' we voyaged '549', '209' seas so '854'ily, l'913'omely mild, '7' '34' space, in repugnance to '119' vengeful err'6', '562'ed vacating '716'elf of '139' '165' '119' urn-'46' prow.
But, at '181', '74' '391'ing to '4' east'869'd, '4' Cape '768'ds began '60'ling '187' us, '6' we rose '6' '947' upon '4' '192', '461'd seas '7' '36' t'43'; '74' '4' ivory-tusked Pequod sharply b'969'd to '4' b'181', '6' go'796' '4' '967' waves in '49' '721'ness, '773', '46' s'60'ers of silver chips, '4' foam-flakes flew '118' '49' bul'869'ks; '98' '34' '14' deso'399' vacuity of '139' '277' '170', '33' '417' '226' to sights '117' dismal '169' '165'.
C'521' to '119' bows, st'868'ge '17'ms in '4' '604' darted '479''49' '6' t'479''49' '165' us; '313' thick in '119' rear flew '4' inscrut'473' sea-ravens. And e'131' '339', perched on '119' '235's, rows of '182' birds '85' '333'; '6' spite of '119' hootings, '17' a '192' '75' obstinately clung to '4' hemp, as '463' '69' deemed '119' ship '96' drifting, uninha'437'ed craft; a '124' ap'378'ed to desolation, '6' t'43''17'e fit roosting-'226' '17' '238' '179''759' selves. And heaved '6' heaved, s'773' un'426'ingly heaved '4' '751' sea, as if '716' vast tides '85' a conscience; '6' '4' '164' mundane soul '85' in anguish '6' remorse '17' '4' '192' sin '6' suffe'847' it '97' b'796'.
Cape of Good Hope, do '69' c'34' ye? Ra'4'r Cape Tor'508'toto, as c'34'ed of yore; '17' '192' '34'u'796' by '4' perfidious silences '7' '165' '97' at'606'ded us, we '295' '119'selves launched '155' '14' tor'508'ted sea, w'43' guilty '213's t'868's'17'med '155' '200' fowls '6' '182' fish, '562'ed condemned to swim on '167''181'ingly '327' '138' '19'n in store, or '942' '7' '751' '769' '327' '138' horizon. But '804', s'56'-'691', '6' unvarying; s'773' directing '716' fountain of fea'4'rs to '4' sky; s'773' beckoning us on '83' '165', '4' solitary jet '72' at '464' be descried.
Du'847' '34' '14' '751'ness of '4' ele'508'ts, Ahab, '463' '652'uming '17' '4' '75' '4' al'344' continual com'128'd of '4' drenched '6' dangerous deck, '128'ifested '4' gloomiest reserve; '6' '117' seldom '169' '167' ad'926'ed '90' mates.

Few or no '429's '85' spoken; '6' '4' silent ship, as if '128'ned by '684'ted sailors in wax, '183' '180' '183' tore on '209' '34' '4' swift '721'ness '6' '431'ness of '4' demoniac waves.

CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.

S'44'h-east'869'd '83' '4' Cape, '141' '4' distant Crozetts, a '68' cruising ground '17' Right Whale'508', a sail loomed '531', '4' G'63'y (Albatross) by '275'. As '50' slowly drew nigh, '83' my lofty perch at '4' '17'e-mast-'342', I '97' a '68' view of '7' sight so remark'473' to a tyro in '4' '458' ocean fi'50'ries—a whaler at sea, '6' '192' ab'708' '83' '179'.
As if '4' waves '97' '91' '597'ers, '14' craft '28' bl'356'ed '46' '4' ske'123'on of a str'6'ed walrus. All d'249' '49' '500's, '14' spectral appea'868'ce '28' traced '31' '192' channels of '796'dened rust, '313' '34' '49' spars '6' '49' rigging '85' '46' '4' thick b'868'ches of trees fur'796' '118' '31' hoar-frost. Only '49' l'969'r sails '85' '451'. A wild sight it '28' to '66' '49' '192'-bearded '73'-'44's at '200' '291' mast-'342's. T'84' '562'ed clad in '4' skins of beasts, so torn '6' bepatched '4' rai'508't '7' '97' survived '958'ly '492' '266' of cruising. St'6'ing in iron hoops nailed to '4' mast, '69' s'103'ed '6' swung '118' a fathom'759' sea; '6' '463', '74' '4' ship slowly glided '452' '447' '119' stern, we '578' '508' in '4' '769' '246' so nigh to '356' '173' '7' we '240' al'344' '19' leaped '83' '4' mast-'342's of '63' ship to '200' of '4' '173'; '332', '200' '17'lorn-'262' fi'50'r'508', mildly '784'ing us as '69' '962'ed, '136' '23' '63' '429' to '119' '249' '73'-'44's, '313' '4' quarter-deck hail '28' '213' '299' '83' below.
"Ship ahoy! Have ye '333' '4' W'479'e Whale?"
But as '4' st'868'ge captain, leaning '118' '4' p'34'id bul'869'ks, '28' in '4' '735' of '966' '90' trumpet to '90' '843', it '96''60' '947' '83' '90' h'6' '155' '4' sea; '6' '4' '768'd '56' rising amain, he in vain strove to '106' '58''968' '299' '327' it. Mean'75' '90' ship '28' s'773' increasing '4' distance '592'ween. While in various silent '103's '4' sea'508' of '4' Pequod '85' evincing '238' observance of '14' ominous incident at '4' '171' mere '508'tion of '4' W'479'e Whale's '275' to an'173' ship, Ahab '17' a mo'508't pa'364'd; it al'344' '562'ed as '463' he '72' '19' l'969''796' a boat to board '4' st'868'ger, '97' '23' '4' threa'606'ing '768'd '17''217'e. But '409' advantage of '90' '768'd'869'd po'421'ion, he '158' seized '90' trumpet, '6' kno'768'g by '49' aspect '7' '4' st'868'ger vessel '28' a Nantucketer '6' '940'ly bound '179', he loudly hailed—"Ahoy t'43'! T'90' is '4' Pequod, bound round '4' '296'! Tell '116' to ad'926' '34' '670' '123'ters to '4' Pacific ocean! '6' '14' '75' '291' '266', if I am '23' at '179', '81' '116' to ad'926' '116' to—"
At '7' mo'508't '4' '149' '830's '85' '807'ly crossed, '6' instantly, '98', in accor'725' '31' '238' singular '103's, shoals of sm'34' harm'759' fish, '7' '17' '96' '433' '165' '97' '91' placidly swimming by '119' '500', darted '170' '31' '11' '562'ed shudde'847' fins, '6' '868'ged '116'selves '17'e '6' aft '31' '4' st'868'ger's flanks. Though in '4' '239' of '90' continual voyagings Ahab '259' of'606' '165' '19' '23''972'd a similar sight, '332', to '138' mono'128'iac '128', '4' veriest trifles capriciously '324'ry '80'ings.
"Swim '170' '83' me, do ye?" murmu'796' Ahab, gazing '118' '155' '4' '604'. T'43' '562'ed '33' '105' in '4' '429's, '33' '4' t'63' conv'784'd '117' of deep '148''759' sadness '169' '4' insane '261' '128' '97' '167' '165' evinced. But '391'ing to '4' steers'128', '94' thus '458' '97' '91' '956' '4' ship in '4' '768'd to diminish '49' '342''103', he cried '44' in '90' '261' lion '915',—"Up helm! Keep '49' '141' round '4' '296'!"
Round '4' '296'! T'43' is '137' in '7' '602' to inspire '896' '699'; '33' w'43'to '185' '34' '7' circumnavigation conduct? Only '209' '539''759' perils to '4' '131' '378' '74'ce we '319'ed, w'43' '200' '7' we '269' '528' secure, '85' '34' '4' '75' '165' us.
Were '14' '296' an '398''759' plain, '6' by sailing east'869'd we '87' '17' '167' r'356' '212' distances, '6' disc'118' sights '117' '584' '6' st'868'ge '169' '138' Cyclades or Isl'6's of King Solomon, '98' t'43' '85' '449' in '4' voyage. But in pursuit of '200' '458' mysteries we '710' of, or in tor'508'ted c'129'e of '7' demon phantom '7', '96' '75' or '173', swims '165' '34' hu'128' '374's; '313' c'129'ing '375' '118' '14' round globe, '69' ei'4'r lead us on in '960'ren mazes or mid'103' '224' us whelmed.




CHAPTER 53. The Gam.

The os'606'sible '385' '65' Ahab '64' '23' go on board of '4' whaler we '97' spoken '28' '14': '4' '768'd '6' sea '592'okened storms. But '140' '97' '14' '23' '91' '4' '390', he '72' '23' '180' '34', '760', '19' boarded '49'—judging by '90' subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it '97' '91' '7', by '4' process of hailing, he '97' obtained a negative '491' to '4' '455' he '186'. For, as it '140'tu'34'y '391'ed '44', he '324'ed '23' to con'563', '140' '17' '401' '294's, '31' '138' st'868'ger captain, '722' he '87' contri'33'e '96' of '7' '782' he so absorbingly sought. But '34' '14' '240' remain inadequately estimated, '85' '23' so'559'hing '136' '43' of '4' peculiar usages of whaling-vessels '74' '381'ing '356' '173' in '17'eign seas, '6' especi'34'y on a common cruising-ground.
If '149' st'868'gers crossing '4' Pine Barrens in New '826' State, or '4' equ'34'y deso'399' Salisbury Plain in Engl'6'; if casu'34'y en'893'e'847' '356' '173' in '375' inhospit'473' wilds, '182' twain, '17' '4' '139' of '116', '51''23' '35' avoid a mutual salutation; '6' '188'ping '17' a mo'508't to inter'397' '4' '212's; '6', '760', '812' d'249' '17' a '313' '6' '426'ing in c'336'rt: '98', '60' '137' '117' natural '7' upon '4' illimit'473' Pine Barrens '6' Salisbury Plains of '4' sea, '149' whaling vessels descrying '356' '173' at '4' '398's of '4' '987'—'141' l'63' Fanning's Isl'6', or '4' '458' '170' King's Mills; '60' '137' '117' natural, I '99', '7' '447' '375' circumstances '182' ships '134' '23' '146' inter'397' hails, '33' '67' '155' s'773' '452'r, '117' fri'398'ly '6' soci'473' cont'735'. And especi'34'y '72' '14' '562' to be a '301' of '239', in '4' '390' of vessels '249'ed in '63' seaport, '6' '94'se captains, '493'rs, '6' '23' a '360' of '4' '508' '36' '369''34'y '677' to '356' '173'; '6' consequently, '19' '34' '563's of '599' domestic '124's to '150' '39'.
For '4' '192' ab'708' ship, '4' '44''869'd-bo'447', '760', '129' '123'ters on board; at '138' rate, '50' '76' be '115' to '123' '49' '19' '96' '888's of a '517' a '407' or '149' '379' '169' '4' '181' '63' on '49' blur'796' '6' thumb-worn files. And in re'391' '17' '7' c'119'tesy, '4' '44''869'd-bound ship '72' receive '4' '399'st whaling in'81'igence '83' '4' cruising-ground to '265' '50' '289' be destined, a '124' of '4' ut'344' importance to '49'. And in degree, '34' '14' '76' '330' '354' c'336'rning whaling vessels crossing '356' '173''s track on '4' cruising-ground '716'elf, '140' '463' '69' '36' equ'34'y '192' ab'708' '83' '179'. For '63' of '116' '289' '19' received a t'868'sfer of '123'ters '83' '96' third, '6' '56' '458' remote vessel; '6' '96' of '200' '123'ters '289' be '17' '4' '151' of '4' ship '50' '56' '381's. Be'500's, '69' '72' ex'397' '4' whaling '212's, '6' '19' an '897''473' chat. For '23' '146' '72' '69' '381' '31' '34' '4' sympathies of sailors, '33' '46'wise '31' '34' '4' peculiar congenialities arising '83' a common pursuit '6' mutu'34'y '904'd privations '6' perils.
Nor '72' difference of '893'ry '106' '138' '131' es'708'ial difference; '7' is, so '192' as '312' '348'ies '613' '63' language, as is '4' '390' '31' Ameri'51's '6' English. Though, to be '115', '83' '4' sm'34' '539' of English whalers, '375' '381'ings do '23' '131' of'606' occur, '6' '74' '69' do occur t'43' is '111' apt to be a '563' of shyness '592'ween '116'; '17' y'119' English'128' is '743' reserved, '6' y'119' Yankee, he '185' '23' fancy '7' '563' of '124' in '138''618' '33' '58''968'. Be'500's, '4' English whalers so'559'imes affect a '207' of '559'ropolitan superiority '118' '4' Ameri'51' whalers; regarding '4' '192', lean Nantucketer, '31' '90' nondescript provincialisms, as a '563' of sea-peasant. But w'43' '14' superiority in '4' English whale'508' '185' re'34'y consist, it '72' be '321' to '99', '66'ing '7' '4' Yankees in '63' '183', collectively, '320' '117' whales '169' '34' '4' English, collectively, in '606' '266'. But '14' is a harm'759' '105' foible in '4' English whale-hunters, '265' '4' Nantucketer '185' '23' '101' '137' to '374'; '307', beca'364' he '359' '7' he '129' a '360' foibles '58''968'.
So, '98', we '66' '7' of '34' ships separately sailing '4' sea, '4' whalers '19' '344' '385' to be soci'473'—'6' '69' '36' so. W'43'as, '96' merchant ships crossing '356' '173''s '830' in '4' mid-Atlantic, '76' of'606''464' '962' on '327' so '137' as a single '429' of recognition, mutu'34'y '537'ting '356' '173' on '4' '530' seas, '46' a brace of dan'474's in B'937''103'; '6' '34' '4' '75' indulging, '760', in finical criticism upon '356' '173''s rig. As '17' Men-of-War, '74' '69' '365' to '381' at sea, '69' '171' go '209' '375' a st'847' of silly bo'768'gs '6' scrapings, '375' a ducking of en'659's, '7' t'43' '185' '23' '562' to be '137' '40'-d'249' '374'y '68'-'76' '6' '411'ly '112' '39' it at '34'. As '678'ing Slave-ships '381'ing, '65', '69' '36' in '375' a prodigious '906', '69' '366' '170' '83' '356' '173' as '358' as '622'. And as '17' Pirates, '74' '69' '365' to cross '356' '173''s cross-b'913', '4' '171' hail is—"How '128'y skulls?"—'4' '276' '103' '7' whalers hail—"How '128'y '960'rels?" And '7' '455' '336' '491'ed, pirates '688''103' steer a'348', '17' '69' '36' infernal villains on '312' '500's, '6' '21' '46' to '66' '118''137' of '356' '173''s villanous '46'nesses.
But '73' at '4' '152'ly, h'913't, unos'606'tatious, hospit'473', soci'473', '523'-'6'-'454' whaler! What '185' '4' whaler do '74' '50' '381's an'173' whaler in '138' '563' of decent wea'4'r? She '129' a "Gam," a '124' so utterly un'677' to '34' '173' ships '7' '69' n'167' '299' of '4' '275' '140'; '6' if by '365' '69' '134' '230' of it, '69' '146' grin at it, '6' rep'545' '544''96' '343' '39' "sp'44'ers" '6' "blubber-boilers," '6' '375' '46' '281' exclamations. Why it is '7' '34' Merchant-sea'508', '6' '516' '34' Pirates '6' Man-of-War's '508', '6' Slave-ship sailors, c'49'ish '375' a scornful '174'ing to'869'ds Whale-ships; '14' is a '455' it '72' be '321' to '491'. Beca'364', in '4' '390' of pirates, '99', I '134' '46' to k'56' whe'4'r '7' profession of '238's '129' '138' peculiar glory '39' it. It so'559'imes '398's in uncommon elevation, indeed; '33' '146' at '4' g'34'ows. And be'500's, '74' a '128' is elevated in '7' odd fashion, he '129' no proper '295'ation '17' '90' superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, '7' in boasting '58''968' to be '530' lifted above a whale'128', in '7' '652'ertion '4' pirate '129' no solid basis to st'6' on.
But '11' is a Gam? You '240' '854' '44' y'119' index-finger '573' up '6' d'249' '4' columns of dictionaries, '6' n'167' '156' '4' '429'. '373' '608''273' n'167' attained to '7' erudition; Noah Webster's ark '185' '23' '330' it. N'167''4''759', '14' '276' expressive '429' '129' '56' '17' '128'y '266' '91' in constant '364' among '96' fifteen thous'6' '354' born Yankees. Certainly, it '460' a definition, '6' '134' be incorporated '155' '4' Lexicon. With '7' view, '123' me '819'edly de'178' it.
GA'941' NOUN—A social '381'ing of '149' (or '117') Whaleships, gener'34'y on a cruising-ground; '74', '180' exc'621'ing hails, '69' ex'397' vi'421's by boats' crews; '4' '149' captains remaining, '17' '4' '75', on board of '63' ship, '6' '4' '149' chief mates on '4' '173'.
T'43' is an'173' '105' item '39' Gamming '265' '259' '23' be '17''61''606' '43'. All professions '19' '238' '249' '105' peculiarities of detail; so '129' '4' whale fi'50'ry. In a pirate, '128'-of-'869', or slave ship, '74' '4' captain is r'969'd '138'w'43' in '90' boat, he '194' '421's in '4' stern '50'ets on a com'17't'473', so'559'imes cushi'63'd s'545' t'43', '6' of'606' steers '58''968' '31' a '281' '105' mil'518'r's '773'er decorated '31' gay cords '6' ribbons. But '4' whale-boat '129' no s'545' astern, no sofa of '7' '563' w'413'ver, '6' no '773'er at '34'. High '464' indeed, if whaling captains '85' wheeled '39' '4' '604' on castors '46' g'44'y '261' alder'508' in pa'606't ch'769's. And as '17' a '773'er, '4' whale-boat n'167' adm'716' of '138' '375' effeminacy; '6' t'43''17'e as in gamming a comp'123'e boat's crew '259' '224' '4' ship, '6' hence as '4' boat steerer or harpo'63'er is of '4' '539', '7' subordinate is '4' steers'128' upon '4' occasion, '6' '4' captain, '305' no '226' to '421' in, is '732'ed '141' to '90' vi'421' '34' st'6'ing '46' a pine tree. And of'606' '1' '76' '23''972' '7' '213' conscious of '4' '495' of '4' '251' visible '296' '426'ing on '58' '83' '4' '500's of '4' '149' ships, '14' st'6'ing captain is '34' a'349' to '4' importance of sustaining '90' dignity by maintaining '90' legs. Nor is '14' '138' '131' '454' '301'; '17' in '90' rear is '4' im'508'se projecting stee'847' oar '479'ting '58' '56' '6' '98' in '4' sm'34' of '90' '78', '4' '180'-oar reciprocating by rapping '90' knees in '569'. He is thus comp'123'ely wedged '165' '6' '528', '6' '51' '146' exp'6' '58''968' '500''103's by '451'tling d'249' on '90' stretched legs; '33' a sudden, violent pitch of '4' boat '76' of'606' go '458' to '739'ple '58', beca'364' length of '295'ation is no'124' '327' corresponding b'504'th.

The Cape of Good Hope, '6' '34' '4' '604'y region round '39' t'43', is '137' '46' '96' '23'ed '492' corners of a '164' '530''103', w'43' '1' '381' '117' travellers '169' in '138' '173' '348'.

In '4' '940' gam '7' ensued '50' '417' us '777' '212's of Moby Dick. To '96' '4' general inte'426' in '4' W'479'e Whale '28' '56' wildly heigh'606'ed by a circumstance of '4' T'249'-Ho's '480', '265' '562'ed obscurely to involve '31' '4' whale a '979' wondrous, inverted vi'421'ation of '63' of '200' so c'34'ed judg'508'ts of God '265' at '464' '36' '136' to '118''101' '96' '508'. T'90' latter circumstance, '31' '716' '249' '348'icular accompani'508'ts, '17'ming '11' '289' be c'34'ed '4' '669' '348' of '4' tragedy '39' to be narrated, n'167' r'356'ed '4' ears of Captain Ahab or '90' mates. For '7' '669' '348' of '4' '480' '28' un'677' to '4' captain of '4' T'249'-Ho '58''968'. It '28' '4' '988' property of '291' confederate '691' sea'508' of '7' ship, '63' of '94'm, it '562's, communicated it to Tashtego '31' Romish injunctions of secrecy, '33' '4' '858'ing '168' Tashtego rambled in '90' '503', '6' revealed so '137' of it in '7' '103', '7' '74' he '28' '830'ned he '87' '23' '35' '31''330' '4' '426'. N'167''4''759', so po'606't an influence '64' '14' '124' '19' on '200' sea'508' in '4' Pequod '94' '246' to '4' '597' k'56'ledge of it, '6' by '375' a st'868'ge delicacy, to c'34' it so, '85' '69' g'118'ned in '14' '301', '7' '69' '764' '4' '669' among '116'selves so '7' it n'167' t'868'spi'796' abaft '4' Pequod's main-mast. Interweaving in '716' proper '226' '14' '967'er th'504' '31' '4' '480' as publicly narrated on '4' ship, '4' '251' of '14' st'868'ge af'807' I '56' proceed to '186' on '181'ing record.
*The ancient whale-cry upon '171' sighting a whale '83' '4' mast-'342', s'773' '364'd by whale'508' in hunting '4' famous G'34'ip'414's terrapin.
For my humor's '997', I sh'34' preserve '4' style in '265' I '336' narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish fri'398's, '63' saint's eve, smoking upon '4' thick-gilt tiled piazza of '4' G'261'en Inn. Of '200' '178' cava'596'rs, '4' '507' Dons, Pedro '6' Sebastian, '85' on '4' '452'r terms '31' me; '6' hence '4' interluding '681' '69' occasion'34'y '186', '6' '265' '36' duly '491'ed at '4' '75'.
"Some '149' '266' prior to my '171' '819'ing '4' '140'ts '265' I am '39' re'230'sing to '1', gentle'508', '4' T'249'-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, '28' cruising in y'119' Pacific '43', '23' '131' '128'y '433'' sail east'869'd '83' '4' eaves of '14' '68' G'261'en Inn. She '28' '96'w'43' to '4' north'869'd of '4' Line. One '339' upon h'6'ling '4' pumps, according to daily usage, it '28' observed '7' '50' '721'e '117' '604' in '49' '330' '169' common. T'84' '340' a s'429'-fish '97' stab'515' '49', gentle'508'. But '4' captain, '305' '96' unusual '385' '17' be'596'ving '7' r'36' '68' '672' a'154'ed '58' in '200' latitudes; '6' t'43''17'e '213' '131' averse to quit '116', '6' '4' leak '23' '213' '98' con'500''796' at '34' dangerous, '463', indeed, '69' '87' '23' '156' it '180' searching '4' '330' as low d'249' as '28' '622' in '743' heavy wea'4'r, '4' ship s'773' continued '49' cruisings, '4' mariners '406' at '4' pumps at wide '6' '454' intervals; '33' no '68' '672' '246'; '117' '433' '277' by, '6' '23' '146' '28' '4' leak '332' undisc'118'ed, '33' it sensibly increased. So '137' so, '7' '56' '409' '96' alarm, '4' captain, '380' '34' sail, s'111'd '170' '17' '4' '958'est harbor among '4' isl'6's, t'43' to '19' '90' hull hove '44' '6' repai'796'.
"Though no sm'34' '962'age '28' '165' '49', '332', if '4' comm'913't '365' fav'119'ed, he '64' '23' at '34' fear '7' '90' ship '72' fo'447' by '4' '103', beca'364' '90' pumps '85' of '4' '258', '6' '213' periodic'34'y re'596'ved at '116', '200' '578'-'6'-thirty '508' of '90' '87' easily '184' '4' ship '523'; n'167' '241' if '4' leak '134' double on '49'. In '350', '35' nigh '4' '251' of '14' '962'age '213' at'606'ded by '131' prosperous breezes, '4' T'249'-Ho '97' '34' '33' '658' arrived in '475' '564'ty at '49' port '327' '4' occurrence of '4' '402' fatality, '97' it '23' '91' '17' '4' brutal '118'bea'847' of Radney, '4' mate, a Vineyarder, '6' '4' '437'terly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lake'128' '6' desperado '83' Buffalo.
"'Lake'128'!—Buffalo! Pray, '11' is a Lake'128', '6' w'43' is Buffalo?' '136' Don Sebastian, rising in '90' s'768'ging mat of gr'652'.
"On '4' eastern shore of '119' Lake Erie, Don; '33'—I crave y'119' c'119'tesy—'289' be, '1' sh'34' '358' '230' fur'4'r of '34' '7'. Now, gentle'508', in squ'36'-sail brigs '6' '291'-masted ships, '35'-nigh as large '6' st'44' as '138' '7' '167' sailed '44' of y'119' '261' C'34'ao to '458' Manilla; '14' Lake'128', in '4' l'6'-locked '374' of '119' America, '97' '332' '91' nurtu'796' by '34' '200' agrarian '523'booting impressions popularly connected '31' '4' '422' ocean. For in '238' interflo'768'g aggregate, '200' gr'6' fresh-'604' seas of '119's,—Erie, '6' Ontario, '6' Huron, '6' Superior, '6' Michigan,—possess an ocean-'46' expansiveness, '31' '128'y of '4' ocean's noblest tra'716'; '31' '128'y of '716' rimmed varieties of races '6' of climes. T'84' contain round archipela'547' of ro'128'tic isles, '140' as '4' Polynesian '604's do; in large '348', '36' sho'796' by '149' '164' contrasting nations, as '4' Atlantic is; '69' furnish '192' mari'75' approaches to '119' numerous territorial colonies '83' '4' East, dotted '34' round '238' banks; '43' '6' t'43' '36' fr'249'ed upon by batteries, '6' by '4' goat-'46' craggy '723's of lofty Mackinaw; '69' '19' '299' '4' fleet th'447'ings of naval victories; at intervals, '69' yield '238' b'356'es to wild '960''960'ians, '94'se '796' '684'ted '352's flash '83' '44' '238' pel'244' wigwams; '17' leagues '6' leagues '36' flanked by ancient '6' unente'796' fo'426's, w'43' '4' g'976' pines st'6' '46' serried '518's of kings in Gothic genealogies; '200' '276' woods harbo'847' wild Afric beasts of prey, '6' silken cr'545'ures '94'se exported furs '145' robes to Tartar Emperors; '69' mirror '4' paved capitals of Buffalo '6' Clevel'6', as '35' as Winneb'414' villages; '69' float a'46' '4' '597'-rigged merchant ship, '4' armed cruiser of '4' State, '4' s'851'er, '6' '4' beech '51'oe; '69' '36' swept by Borean '6' dismasting b'181's as direful as '138' '7' lash '4' salted wave; '69' k'56' '11' shipwrecks '36', '17' '44' of sight of l'6', '60''167' inl'6', '69' '19' dr'249'ed '597' '128'y a mid'168' ship '31' '34' '716' shrieking crew. Thus, gentle'508', '463' an inl'6'er, Steelkilt '28' wild-ocean born, '6' wild-ocean nurtu'796'; as '137' of an audacious mariner as '138'. And '17' Radney, '463' in '90' infancy he '289' '19' laid '58' d'249' on '4' l'63' Nantucket b'356', to nurse at '90' maternal sea; '463' in '180' '139' he '97' '192' '858'ed '119' austere Atlantic '6' y'119' contemplative Pacific; '332' '28' he '538' as vengeful '6' '597' of social quarrel as '4' '78'woods sea'128', fresh '83' '4' latitudes of buck-horn '627'd bowie-knives. Yet '28' '14' Nantucketer a '128' '31' '96' '68'-'374'ed tra'716'; '6' '14' Lake'128', a mariner, '94' '463' a '563' of d'779' indeed, '240' '332' by inflexible firmness, '146' tempe'796' by '7' common decency of hu'128' recognition '265' is '4' '80'est slave's '40'; thus tr'545'ed, '14' Steelkilt '97' '192' '91' retained harm'759' '6' docile. At '34' '140'ts, he '97' '831'd so thus '458'; '33' Radney '28' doomed '6' '721'e '721', '6' Steelkilt—'33', gentle'508', '1' sh'34' '230'.
"It '28' '23' '117' '169' a '183' or '149' at '4' fur'4'st '180' '378'ing '49' prow '17' '49' isl'6' '19'n, '7' '4' T'249'-Ho's leak '562'ed '158' increasing, '33' '146' so as to require an '612' or '117' at '4' pumps e'131' '183'. You '259' k'56' '7' in a '451'tled '6' civilized ocean '46' '119' Atlantic, '17' example, '96' skippers '54' '105' of pumping '238' '251' '103' across it; '463' of a s'773', '503'y '168', '134' '4' '493'r of '4' deck '308' to '353' '90' duty in '7' '952', '4' probability '72' be '7' he '6' '90' shipmates '72' n'167' '158' '219' it, on ac'893' of '34' '524' gently subsiding to '4' bottom. Nor in '4' solitary '6' savage seas '458' '83' '1' to '4' west'869'd, gentle'508', is it alto'42''49' unusual '17' ships to '184' clanging at '238' pump-'627's in '597' chorus '140' '17' a voyage of con'500'r'473' length; '7' is, if it '596' '549' a tolerably accessible coast, or if '138' '173' '385''473' retr'545' is af'17'ded '116'. It is '146' '74' a leaky vessel is in '96' '131' '44' of '4' '103' '348' of '200' '604's, '96' re'34'y l'6''759' latitude, '7' '49' captain begins to '174' a '105' anxious.
"Much '14' '103' '97' it '91' '31' '4' T'249'-Ho; so '74' '49' leak '28' '295' gaining '336' '117', t'43' '28' in '350' '96' sm'34' c'336'rn '128'ifested by s'167'al of '49' '624'; especi'34'y by Radney '4' mate. He com'128'ded '4' upper sails to be '35' hoisted, '50'eted '179' a'212', '6' e'131' '103' exp'6'ed to '4' breeze. Now '14' Radney, I '803', '28' as '105' of a co'869'd, '6' as '105' inc'518'd to '138' '563' of nervous apprehensiveness '678'ing '90' '249' '369' as '138' fear'759', un'54'ing cr'545'ure on l'6' or on sea '7' '1' '51' conveniently '805', gentle'508'. T'43''17'e '74' he '592'rayed '14' solicitude '39' '4' '564'ty of '4' ship, '96' of '4' sea'508' decla'796' '7' it '28' '146' on ac'893' of '90' '213' a '348' '249'er in '49'.

"Now, as '1' '35' k'56', it is '23' seldom '4' '390' in '14' conventional '296' of '119's—'604'y or '173'wise; '7' '74' a '369' '226'd in com'128'd '118' '90' '947'ow-'508' '156's '63' of '116' to be '131' '659'ifi'51'tly '90' superior in general p'852' of '128'hood, '688''103' '485' '7' '128' he c'336'ives an unconquer'473' dis'46' '6' '437'terness; '6' if he '19' a '365' he '76' '732' d'249' '6' pulverize '7' subaltern's t'969'r, '6' '106' a '105' heap of dust of it.

But Radney, '4' mate, '28' ugly as a mule; '332' as '321'y, as stubborn, as malicious. He '64' '23' '112' Steelkilt, '6' Steelkilt k'212' it.
"Espying '4' mate dra'768'g '958' as he '28' toiling at '4' pump '31' '4' '426', '4' Lake'128' affected '23' to '23''972' '58', '33' unawed, '277' on '31' '90' gay bante'847's.
"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, '30' a '349'ly leak '14'; '330' a '51'nikin, '63' of ye, '6' '123''s '19' a taste. By '4' Lord, '30' '736' bottling!

"'Damn y'119' '495'! '11''s '7' pump '188'ping '17'?' roa'796' Radney, pre'606'ding '23' to '19' '299' '4' sailors' '150'. 'Th'447' '170' at it!'
"'Aye, aye, '284',' '136' Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. 'Lively, '311's, '349'ly, '56'!'

"Now, gentle'508', sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a '747' of ho'364''330' '176' '265' in '34' '464' '33' raging gales is regularly at'606'ded to e'131' '140'ing; it '129' '91' '677' to be d'63' in '4' '390' of ships '735'u'34'y fo'447'ing at '4' '75'. Such, gentle'508', is '4' inflexibility of sea-usages '6' '4' instinctive '112' of n'545'ness in sea'508'; '96' of '94'm '72' '23' '76'ingly dr'249' '327' '171' '28'hing '238' '352's.

After '409' counsel '31' '90' '493'rs, he ancho'796' '4' ship as '458' '141' shore as '622'; loaded '6' '868' '44' '90' '149' '51'non '83' '4' bows; stacked '90' muskets on '4' poop; '6' '869'ning '4' Isl'6'ers '23' to approach '4' ship at '238' peril, '111'k '63' '128' '31' '58', '6' '451'ting '4' sail of '90' '258' whale-boat, stee'796' '688' '165' '4' '768'd '17' Ta'479'i, '401' hund'796' miles distant, to procure a rein'17'ce'508't to '90' crew.
"On '4' '492'th '183' of '4' sail, a large '51'oe '28' descried, '265' '562'ed to '19' '678'ed at a low isle of corals. He stee'796' '170' '83' it; '33' '4' savage craft bore d'249' on '58'; '6' '358' '4' '915' of Steelkilt hailed '58' to heave to, or he '72' '366' '58' '447' '604'. The captain '986'ed a pistol. With '63' foot on '356' prow of '4' yoked '869'-'51'oes, '4' Lake'128' laughed '58' to scorn; '652'u'847' '58' '7' if '4' pistol so '137' as clicked in '4' lock, he '72' bury '58' in bubbles '6' foam.
"'What do '1' '53' of me?' cried '4' captain.
"'W'43' '36' '1' bound? '6' '17' '11' '36' '1' bound?' de'128'ded Steelkilt; 'no '596's.'
"'I am bound to Ta'479'i '17' '117' '508'.'
"'Very '68'. Let me board '1' a mo'508't—I '67' in peace.' With '7' he leaped '83' '4' '51'oe, swam to '4' boat; '6' climbing '4' '723'wale, s'111'd '352' to '352' '31' '4' captain.
"'Cross y'119' arms, '284'; '687' '78' y'119' '342'. Now, rep'545' '180' me. As '358' as Steelkilt '224's me, I '746' to b'356' '14' boat on yonder isl'6', '6' remain t'43' '578' '433'. If I do '23', '289' '703'ning strike me!'
"'A '281' scholar,' laughed '4' Lake'128'. 'Adios, Senor!' '6' leaping '155' '4' sea, he swam '78' to '90' comrades.
"Watching '4' boat '773' it '28' '807'ly b'356'ed, '6' drawn up to '4' roots of '4' cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt '721'e sail '158', '6' in due '75' arrived at Ta'479'i, '90' '249' '226' of destination.

CHAPTER 55. Of '4' Monstrous Pictures of Whales.

I sh'34' ere '192' '684't to '1' as '35' as '63' '51' '327' '51'vas, so'559'hing '46' '4' '354' '17'm of '4' whale as he '735'u'34'y appears to '4' '784' of '4' whale'128' '74' in '90' '249' absolute '618' '4' whale is moo'796' '549''500' '4' whale-ship so '7' he '51' be '807'ly '761'ped upon t'43'. It '289' be '736' '313', t'43''17'e, previously to advert to '200' curious imaginary portra'716' of '58' '265' '140' d'249' to '4' '986' '183' confidently ch'34'enge '4' faith of '4' l'6's'128'. It is '75' to '451' '4' '296' '40' in '14' '301', by proving '375' '648's of '4' whale '34' '208'.
It '289' be '7' '4' primal s'119'ce of '34' '200' pictorial delusions '76' be '295' among '4' '261'est Hindoo, Egyptian, '6' Grecian sculptures. For '167' '317' '200' inventive '33' unscrupulous '464' '74' on '4' marble panellings of temples, '4' pedestals of statues, '6' on shields, med'34'ions, cups, '6' coins, '4' dolphin '28' drawn in scales of chain-armor '46' Saladin's, '6' a hel'559'ed '342' '46' St. '791''s; '167' '317' '98' '129' so'559'hing of '4' '276' '563' of l'972'nse prevailed, '23' '146' in '344' popular '648's of '4' whale, '33' in '128'y scientific '986'ations of '58'.
Now, by '34' odds, '4' '344' ancient extant portrait '138''103's purporting to be '4' whale's, is to be '295' in '4' famous cavern-pa'152'a of Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain '7' in '4' al'344' '398''759' sculptures of '7' immemorial pa'152'a, '34' '4' trades '6' pursu'716', e'131' c'336'iv'473' avocation of '128', '85' pre'575'd ages '165' '138' of '116' '735'u'34'y '246' '155' '213'. No '683' '98', '7' in '96' '563' '119' noble profession of whaling '134' '19' '91' t'43' s'97''969'd '17'th. The Hindoo whale refer'796' to, occurs in a separate de'348''508't of '4' w'34', depicting '4' in'324'nation of Vishnu in '4' '17'm of levia'169', '819'edly '677' as '4' Matse Avatar. But '463' '14' sculpture is '499' '128' '6' '499' whale, so as '146' to '145' '4' tail of '4' latter, '332' '7' sm'34' section of '58' is '34' '208'. It '388' '117' '46' '4' '890''847' tail of an anaconda, '169' '4' b'937' palms of '4' '354' whale's majestic flukes.
But go to '4' '261' G'34'eries, '6' '73' '56' at a '164' '917'tian '684'ter's portrait of '14' fish; '17' he succeeds no '166' '169' '4' antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido's '648' of Perseus rescuing Andromeda '83' '4' sea-monster or whale. W'43' '64' Guido '42' '4' model of '375' a st'868'ge cr'545'ure as '7'? Nor '185' Hogarth, in '684'ting '4' '276' scene in '90' '249' "Perseus Desc'398'ing," '106' '44' '63' w'479' '166'. The huge corpulence of '7' Hogarthian monster undu'399's on '4' sur'352', s'324'cely dra'768'g '63' inch of '604'. It '129' a '563' of '60'dah on '716' '78', '6' '716' dis'606'ded tusked '843' '155' '265' '4' '899'ows '36' rolling, '240' be '645' '17' '4' Traitors' Gate leading '83' '4' Thames by '604' '155' '4' T'969'r. Then, t'43' '36' '4' Prodromus whales of '261' Scotch Sibbald, '6' Jonah's whale, as depicted in '4' prints of '261' Bibles '6' '4' '537's of '261' primers. What sh'34' be '136' of '182'? As '17' '4' '560'-binder's whale '768'ding '46' a vine-s'150' round '4' stock of a desc'398'ing anchor—as stamped '6' gilded on '4' '78's '6' title-pages of '128'y '560's '312' '261' '6' '212'—'7' is a '131' '648'sque '33' purely fabulous cr'545'ure, imitated, I '101' it, '83' '4' '46' '575's on antique vases. Though univers'34'y denominated a dolphin, I n'167''4''759' c'34' '14' '560'-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; beca'364' it '28' so in'606'ded '74' '4' dev'972' '28' '171' introduced. It '28' introduced by an '261' Italian publi'50'r '96'w'43' '39' '4' 15th century, du'847' '4' Revival of Learning; '6' in '200' '433', '6' '140' d'249' to a comparatively '399' period, dolphins '85' popularly '340' to be a species of '4' Levia'169'.
In '4' vignettes '6' '173' embellish'508'ts of '96' ancient '560's '1' '76' at '464' '381' '31' '131' curious '678'es at '4' whale, w'43' '34' '128'ner of sp'44's, jets d'eau, '576' sp'847's '6' '690', Saratoga '6' Baden-Baden, '67' bubbling up '83' '90' unexhausted brain. In '4' title-page of '4' original edition of '4' "Advance'508't of Learning" '1' '76' '156' '96' curious whales.
But quitting '34' '182' unprofessional attempts, '123' us glance at '200' '648's of levia'169' purporting to be sober, scientific de'518'ations, by '200' '94' k'56'. In '261' Harris's collection of voyages t'43' '36' '96' p'399's of whales extr'735'ed '83' a Dutch '560' of voyages, A.'636' 1671, entitled "A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in '4' ship Jonas in '4' Whale, Peter Peter'273' of Friesl'6', master." In '63' of '200' p'399's '4' whales, '46' '164' rafts of logs, '36' re'986'ed '666' among '972'-isles, '31' '691' bears '573' '118' '238' '565' '78's. In an'173' p'399', '4' prodigious bl'447' is '721'e of re'986'ing '4' whale '31' perp'398'icular flukes.
Then '158', t'43' is an imposing quarto, writ'606' by '63' Captain Colnett, a Post Captain in '4' English navy, entitled "A Voyage round Cape Horn '155' '4' S'44'h Seas, '17' '4' purpose of ex'606'ding '4' Spermaceti Whale Fi'50'ries." In '14' '560' is an '44''518' purporting to be a "Picture of a Phy'451'er or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale '83' '63' '466' on '4' coast of Mexico, August, 1793, '6' hoisted on deck." I doubt '23' '4' captain '97' '14' veracious '648' '645' '17' '4' benefit of '90' marines. To '508'tion '33' '63' '124' '39' it, '123' me '99' '7' it '129' an '784' '265' app'596'd, according to '4' ac'624'ing scale, to a '597' gr'249' sperm whale, '72' '106' '4' '784' of '7' whale a bow-'768'dow '96' '401' '908' '192'. Ah, my g'34'ant captain, '65' '64' ye '23' '145' us Jonah '262' '44' of '7' '784'!
Nor '36' '4' '344' conscientious compilations of Natural Hi'480' '17' '4' benefit of '4' '507' '6' '606'der, '523' '83' '4' '276' heinousness of mis'101'. Look at '7' popular '176' "G'261'smith's Animated Nature." In '4' ab'885'd London edition of 1807, t'43' '36' p'399's of an '34'eged "whale" '6' a "narwhale." I do '23' '392' to '562' inelegant, '33' '14' unsightly whale '388' '137' '46' an am'186'ated sow; '6', as '17' '4' narwhale, '63' glimpse at it is '243' to amaze '63', '7' in '14' nineteenth century '375' a hippogriff '87' be palmed '17' genuine upon '138' in'81'igent public of '351''311's.
Then, '158', in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a '164' natura'919', publi'50'd a scientific systemized whale '560', w'43'in '36' s'167'al '648's of '4' '465' species of '4' Levia'169'. All '182' '36' '23' '146' incorrect, '33' '4' '648' of '4' Myst'972'tus or Greenl'6' whale ('7' is to '99', '4' Right whale), '140' Scoresby, a '192' experienced '128' as '678'ing '7' species, decl'36's '23' to '19' '716' '893'er'348' in nature.
But '4' placing of '4' cap-'50'af to '34' '14' bl'447'ing '355' '28' reserved '17' '4' scientific F'796'erick Cuvier, '411' to '4' famous Baron. In 1836, he publi'50'd a Natural Hi'480' of Whales, in '265' he '145's '11' he c'34's a '648' of '4' Sperm Whale. Be'17'e sho'768'g '7' '648' to '138' Nantucketer, '1' '97' '258' provide '17' y'119' summary retr'545' '83' Nantucket. In a '429', F'796'erick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is '23' a Sperm Whale, '33' a squash. Of '239', he n'167' '97' '4' benefit of a whaling voyage ('375' '508' seldom '19'), '33' '74'ce he derived '7' '648', '94' '51' '81'? Perhaps he '61' it as '90' scientific p'796'ecessor in '4' '276' field, Desm'36'st, '61' '63' of '90' au'98'tic abortions; '7' is, '83' a Chinese dra'768'g. And '11' '563' of '349'ly lads '31' '4' pencil '200' Chinese '36', '128'y queer cups '6' saucers in'17'm us.
As '17' '4' '659'-'684'ters' whales '333' in '4' '811's '621'ing '118' '4' shops of oil-'334'ers, '11' sh'34' be '136' of '116'? T'84' '36' gener'34'y Ric'321' III. whales, '31' dromedary humps, '6' '131' savage; '448''692'ing on '291' or '492' sailor tarts, '7' is whaleboats '597' of mariners: '238' de'17'mities flo'447'ing in seas of '593' '6' blue '684't.
But '182' '128'if'261' mis'726' in depicting '4' whale '36' '23' so '131' surprising '180' '34'. Con'500'r! Most of '4' scientific dra'768'gs '19' '91' '645' '83' '4' str'6'ed fish; '6' '182' '36' '39' as correct as a dra'768'g of a wrecked ship, '31' '785'n '78', '72' correctly re'986' '4' noble animal '716'elf in '34' '716' unda'50'd p'852' of hull '6' spars. Though elephants '19' s'111'd '17' '238' '597'-lengths, '4' '565' Levia'169' '129' n'167' '332' '807'ly floated '58''968' '17' '90' portrait. The '565' whale, in '90' '597' majesty '6' '659'ifi'51'ce, is '146' to be '333' at sea in unfathom'473' '604's; '6' afloat '4' vast bulk of '58' is '44' of sight, '46' a launched '518'-of-battle ship; '6' '44' of '7' ele'508't it is a '124' etern'34'y im'622' '17' mortal '128' to hoist '58' bodily '155' '4' '769', so as to preserve '34' '90' '240'y s'35's '6' undulations. And, '23' to '613' of '4' '530'ly presum'473' difference of cont'119' '592'ween a '507' sucking whale '6' a '597'-gr'249' Platonian Levia'169'; '332', '140' in '4' '390' of '63' of '200' '507' sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, '375' is '98' '4' '44'l'6'ish, eel-'46', limbe'796', varying shape of '58', '7' '90' precise expression '4' d'779' '58''968' '87' '23' '756'.
But it '289' be fancied, '7' '83' '4' naked ske'123'on of '4' str'6'ed whale, accurate hints '289' be derived '678'ing '90' '354' '17'm. Not at '34'. For it is '63' of '4' '117' curious '124's '39' '14' Levia'169', '7' '90' ske'123'on '145's '131' '105' '256' of '90' general shape. Though Jeremy '742'tham's ske'123'on, '265' '621's '17' '51'delabra in '4' library of '63' of '90' exe'537'ors, correctly conveys '4' '256' of a burly-br'969'd utilitarian '261' gentle'128', '31' '34' Jeremy's '173' leading '771' char'735'eristics; '332' no'124' of '14' '207' '87' be infer'796' '83' '138' levia'169''s articu'399'd b'913'. In '418', as '4' '164' Hunter '415', '4' mere ske'123'on of '4' whale bears '4' '276' relation to '4' '597'y invested '6' padded animal as '4' insect '185' to '4' chrysalis '7' so roundingly envelopes it. T'90' peculiarity is strikingly evinced in '4' '342', as in '96' '348' of '14' '560' '76' be incident'34'y s'60'n. It is '516' '131' curiously dis'412'ed in '4' '500' fin, '4' b'913' of '265' al'344' '304' '491' to '4' b'913' of '4' hu'128' h'6', minus '146' '4' thumb. T'90' fin '129' '492' regular b'63'-fingers, '4' index, '845', '847', '6' '105' finger. But '34' '182' '36' per'128'ently lodged in '238' fleshy c'118'ing, as '4' hu'128' fingers in an artificial c'118'ing. "How'167' reck'759'ly '4' whale '289' so'559'imes serve us," '136' humorous Stubb '63' '183', "he '51' n'167' be truly '136' to '627' us '327' mit'606's."
For '34' '182' '385's, '98', '138' '103' '1' '289' '73' at it, '1' '259' '460' conclude '7' '4' '164' Levia'169' is '7' '63' cr'545'ure in '4' '296' '265' '259' remain un'684'ted to '4' '181'.

So t'43' is no '987'ly '103' of '156'ing '44' precisely '11' '4' whale re'34'y '388' '46'. And '4' '146' mode in '265' '1' '51' derive '140' a toler'473' '256' of '90' '565' cont'119', is by '45' a whaling y'119''968'; '33' by so '143', '1' '366' no sm'34' risk of '213' etern'34'y stove '6' sunk by '58'. W'43''17'e, it '562's to me '1' '97' '258' '23' be '111' '692'idious in y'119' curio'421'y '678'ing '14' Levia'169'.




CHAPTER 56. Of '4' Less Err'63'ous Pictures of Whales, '6' '4' True Pictures of Whaling Scenes.

In connexion '31' '4' monstrous '648's of whales, I am '777'ly tempted '43' to enter upon '200' s'773' '117' monstrous stories of '116' '265' '36' to be '295' in '979' '560's, '312' ancient '6' modern, especi'34'y in Pliny, Purc'129', Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I '962' '7' '301' by.
I k'56' of '146' '492' publi'50'd '44''518's of '4' '164' Sperm Whale; Colnett's, Huggins's, F'796'erick Cuvier's, '6' Beale's. In '4' previous chapter Colnett '6' Cuvier '19' '91' refer'796' to. Huggins's is '458' '166' '169' '238's; '33', by '164' odds, Beale's is '4' '258'. All Beale's dra'768'gs of '14' whale '36' '68', '722'ing '4' '845' '575' in '4' '648' of '291' whales in various attitudes, capping '90' '347' chapter. His '569'is'747', boats attacking Sperm Whales, '463' no doubt calcu'399'd to excite '4' civil scepticism of '96' parlor '508', is admirably correct '6' '139'-'46' in '716' general effect. Some of '4' Sperm Whale dra'768'gs in '371' '795' Br'249'e '36' '281' correct in cont'119'; '33' '69' '36' wretchedly engraved. That is '23' '90' '603' '463'.
Of '4' Right Whale, '4' '258' '44''518' '648's '36' in Scoresby; '33' '69' '36' drawn on '111' sm'34' a scale to convey a de'284''473' impression. He '129' '33' '63' '648' of whaling scenes, '6' '14' is a sad deficiency, beca'364' it is by '375' '648's '146', '74' at '34' '35' d'63', '7' '1' '51' derive '138''124' '46' a '350'ful '256' of '4' '565' whale as '333' by '90' '565' hunters.
But, '645' '17' '34' in '34', by '458' '4' '178'st, '463' in '96' details '23' '4' '344' correct, '986'ations of whales '6' whaling scenes to be '138'w'43' '295', '36' '149' large French engravings, '35' exe'924'd, '6' '645' '83' '684'tings by '63' Garnery. Respectively, '69' re'986' attacks on '4' Sperm '6' Right Whale. In '4' '171' engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in '597' majesty of '240', '22' risen ben'545'h '4' boat '83' '4' pro'427'dities of '4' ocean, '6' bea'847' '530' in '4' '769' upon '90' '78' '4' terrific wreck of '4' stoven '519'ks. The prow of '4' boat is '348'i'34'y un'785'n, '6' is drawn '22' balancing upon '4' monster's spine; '6' st'6'ing in '7' prow, '17' '7' '63' single incom'186''473' flash of '75', '1' be'330' an oars'128', '499' shrouded by '4' incensed boiling sp'44' of '4' whale, '6' in '4' '735' of leaping, as if '83' a precip'972'. The '735'ion of '4' '251' '124' is '683''597'y '68' '6' '354'. The '499'-emptied '518'-tub floats on '4' whi'606'ed sea; '4' wooden poles of '4' spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; '4' '342's of '4' swimming crew '36' scatte'796' '39' '4' whale in contrasting expressions of aff'40'; '313' in '4' '751' stormy distance '4' ship is bea'847' d'249' upon '4' scene. Serious '603' '240' be '295' '31' '4' anatomical details of '14' whale, '33' '123' '7' '962'; '317', '17' '4' '139' of me, I '87' '23' draw so '68' a '63'.
In '4' '347' engraving, '4' boat is in '4' '735' of dra'768'g '549''500' '4' '960'nacled flank of a large '573' Right Whale, '7' rolls '90' '751' weedy bulk in '4' sea '46' '96' mossy rock-slide '83' '4' Pat'414'nian cliffs. His jets '36' erect, '597', '6' '751' '46' soot; so '7' '83' so abounding a smoke in '4' c'58'ney, '1' '72' '54' t'43' '259' be a brave supper cooking in '4' '164' b'969'ls below. Sea fowls '36' pecking at '4' sm'34' crabs, s'245'-fish, '6' '173' sea '51''474's '6' mac'324'oni, '265' '4' Right Whale so'559'imes '324'ries on '90' pestilent '78'. And '34' '4' '313' '4' thick-lipped levia'169' is rushing '209' '4' deep, '568' tons of tumultuous '691' curds in '90' '830', '6' ca'970' '4' s'703' boat to rock in '4' s'35's '46' a skiff '808' nigh '4' paddle-wheels of an ocean s'851'er. Thus, '4' '17'eground is '34' raging commotion; '33' '528', in admir'473' artistic contrast, is '4' gl'652'y level of a sea be'804'ed, '4' drooping unstarched sails of '4' '637''759' ship, '6' '4' inert m'652' of a '314' whale, a conque'796' '17'tress, '31' '4' flag of capture lazily '621'ing '83' '4' whale-pole inserted '155' '90' sp'44'-hole.
Who Garnery '4' '684'ter is, or '28', I k'56' '23'. But my '139' '17' it he '28' ei'4'r pr'735'ic'34'y conversant '31' '90' subject, or '234' marvellously tuto'796' by '96' experienced whale'128'. The French '36' '4' lads '17' '684'ting '735'ion. Go '6' gaze upon '34' '4' '684'tings of Europe, '6' w'43' '76' '1' '156' '375' a g'34'ery of '565' '6' brea'124' commotion on '51'vas, as in '7' triumphal h'34' at Versailles; w'43' '4' be'330'er '535's '90' '103', pell-mell, '209' '4' conse'537'ive '164' battles of F'868'ce; w'43' e'131' s'429' '562's a flash of '4' Nor'4'rn Lights, '6' '4' successive armed kings '6' Emperors dash by, '46' a charge of cr'249'ed centaurs? Not '94'lly un'736'y of a '226' in '7' g'34'ery, '36' '182' sea battle-'747's of Garnery.
The natural aptitude of '4' French '17' seizing '4' '648'squeness of '124's '562's to be peculiarly evinced in '11' '684'tings '6' engravings '69' '19' of '238' whaling scenes. With '23' '63' '606'th of Engl'6''s experience in '4' fi'50'ry, '6' '23' '4' thous'6'th '348' of '7' of '4' Ameri'51's, '69' '19' n'167''4''759' furni'50'd '312' nations '31' '4' '146' '914'ed sketches at '34' cap'473' of conveying '4' '272' spirit of '4' whale hunt. For '4' '344' '348', '4' English '6' Ameri'51' whale draughts'508' '562' '797'ly con'606't '31' '986'ing '4' mechanical '44''518' of '124's, '375' as '4' va'51't profile of '4' whale; '265', so '458' as '648'squeness of effect is '936', is '39' tantamount to sketching '4' profile of a pyramid. '938'n Scoresby, '4' '22'ly re'56'ned Right whale'128', '180' '631' us a stiff '597' length of '4' Greenl'6' whale, '6' '291' or '492' delicate miniatures of narwhales '6' porpoises, tr'545's us to a series of cl'652'ical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, '6' grapnels; '6' '31' '4' microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck subm'716' to '4' inspection of a shive'847' '296' ninety-'578' fac-similes of magnified Arctic s'56' crystals. I '80' no disparage'508't to '4' excellent voyager (I hon'119' '58' '17' a vete'868'), '33' in so '425' a '301' it '28' '658' an '118'sight '23' to '19' procu'796' '17' e'131' crystal a sworn affidavit '645' '165' a Greenl'6' Just'972' of '4' Peace.
In addition to '200' '178' engravings '83' Garnery, t'43' '36' '149' '173' French engravings '736'y of '23'e, by '96' '63' '94' subscribes '58''968' "H. Dur'6'." One of '116', '463' '23' precisely adapted to '119' '986' purpose, n'167''4''759' '922's '508'tion on '173' ac'893's. It is a '935' noon-scene among '4' isles of '4' Pacific; a French whaler ancho'796', inshore, in a '804', '6' lazily '409' '604' on board; '4' loosened sails of '4' ship, '6' '4' '192' '224's of '4' palms in '4' '78'ground, '312' drooping to'42''49' in '4' breeze'759' '769'. The effect is '131' '178', '74' con'500''796' '31' reference to '716' '986'ing '4' '321'y fi'50'r'508' '447' '63' of '238' '360' aspects of oriental repose. The '173' engraving is '538' a '465' af'807': '4' ship hove-to upon '4' '422' sea, '6' in '4' '131' '374' of '4' Levia'169'ic '139', '31' a Right Whale '549''500'; '4' vessel (in '4' '735' of '537'ting-in) hove '118' to '4' monster as if to a quay; '6' a boat, hurriedly pushing '141' '83' '14' scene of '735'ivity, is '39' '631' c'129'e to whales in '4' distance. The harpoons '6' lances '596' levelled '17' '364'; '291' oars'508' '36' '22' '451'ting '4' mast in '716' hole; '313' '83' a sudden roll of '4' sea, '4' '105' craft st'6's '499'-erect '44' of '4' '604', '46' a rea'847' horse. From '4' ship, '4' smoke of '4' tor'508'ts of '4' boiling whale is '45' up '46' '4' smoke '118' a village of smithies; '6' to '768'd'869'd, a '751' cloud, rising up '31' earnest of squ'34's '6' rains, '562's to quicken '4' '735'ivity of '4' excited sea'508'.




CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in St'63'; in Mountains; in Stars.

On T'969'r-hill, as '1' go d'249' to '4' London docks, '1' '289' '19' '333' a crippled beggar (or kedger, as '4' sailors '99') '956' a '684'ted board '165' '58', re'986'ing '4' tragic scene in '265' he '387' '90' leg. T'43' '36' '291' whales '6' '291' boats; '6' '63' of '4' boats (presumed to contain '4' '376'ing leg in '34' '716' original integrity) is '213' c'366'ched by '4' jaws of '4' '17'e'344' whale. Any '75' '182' '606' '266', '69' '81' me, '129' '7' '128' held up '7' '648', '6' exhi'437'ed '7' stump to an inc'796'ulous '296'. But '4' '75' of '90' '22'ification '129' '56' '67'. His '291' whales '36' as '68' whales as '85' '167' publi'50'd in Wapping, at '138' rate; '6' '90' stump as un'455''473' a stump as '138' '1' '76' '156' in '4' western clea'847's. But, '463' '17' '167' mounted on '7' stump, n'167' a stump-speech '185' '4' '719' whale'128' '106'; '33', '31' d'249'cast '495', st'6's rue'597'y contemplating '90' '249' am'186'ation.
Through'44' '4' Pacific, '6' '516' in Nantucket, '6' New Bed'17'd, '6' Sag Harbor, '1' '76' '67' across '349'ly sketches of whales '6' whaling-scenes, graven by '4' fi'50'r'508' '116'selves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or la'474's' busks wrought '44' of '4' Right Whale-b'63', '6' '173' '46' skrimsh'6'er articles, as '4' whale'508' c'34' '4' numerous '105' ingenious contrivances '69' elaborately '324've '44' of '4' rough material, in '238' '520' of ocean lei'115'. Some of '116' '19' '105' '990'es of dentistical-'262' imple'508'ts, speci'34'y in'606'ded '17' '4' skrimsh'6'e'847' '355'. But, in general, '69' toil '31' '238' jack-knives al'63'; '6', '31' '7' al'344' omnipo'606't '111'l of '4' sailor, '69' '76' '391' '1' '44' '138''124' '1' '142', in '4' '103' of a mariner's fancy.
Long exile '83' '917''606'dom '6' civilization inevitably '426'ores a '128' to '7' condition in '265' God '226'd '58', i.e. '11' is c'34'ed savagery. Y'119' '354' whale-hunter is as '137' a savage as an Iroquois. I '302' am a savage, '249'ing no '34'egiance '33' to '4' King of '4' Cannibals; '6' '325' at '138' mo'508't to rebel '485' '58'.
Now, '63' of '4' peculiar char'735'eristics of '4' savage in '90' domestic '520', is '90' '533' patience of indus'244'. An ancient Hawaiian '869'-'801' or spear-paddle, in '716' '597' multipli'709' '6' elaboration of '324'ving, is as '164' a trophy of hu'128' pers'167'ance as a Latin lexicon. For, '31' '33' a '437' of '785'n sea-s'245' or a shark's '111'th, '7' miraculous intricacy of wooden net-'176' '129' '91' achieved; '6' it '129' cost steady '266' of steady application.
As '31' '4' Hawaiian savage, so '31' '4' '691' sailor-savage. With '4' '276' marvellous patience, '6' '31' '4' '276' single shark's '111'th, of '90' '63' '719' jack-knife, he '76' '324've '1' a '437' of b'63' sculpture, '23' '538' as '176''128''46', '33' as '452' packed in '716' maziness of de'659', as '4' Greek savage, Achilles's shield; '6' '597' of '960''960'ic spirit '6' suggestiveness, as '4' prints of '7' '178' '261' Dutch savage, Albert Durer.
Wooden whales, or whales '537' in profile '44' of '4' sm'34' '967' slabs of '4' noble S'44'h Sea '869'-wood, '36' frequently '559' '31' in '4' '17'ecastles of Ameri'51' whalers. Some of '116' '36' d'63' '31' '137' accuracy.
At '96' '261' g'473'-roofed '893'ry ho'364's '1' '76' '66' br'652' whales hung by '4' tail '17' knockers to '4' '937'-'500' '450'. When '4' porter is '503'y, '4' anvil-'342'ed whale '72' be '258'. But '182' knocking whales '36' seldom remark'473' as faithful es'415'. On '4' spires of '96' '261'-fashi'63'd churches '1' '76' '66' '50'et-iron whales '226'd t'43' '17' wea'4'r-cocks; '33' '69' '36' so elevated, '6' be'500's '7' '36' to '34' in'606'ts '6' purposes so labelled '31' "H'6's '141'!" '1' '51''23' exa'462' '116' '452'ly '243' to decide upon '238' merit.
In bony, ribby regions of '4' '987', w'43' at '4' base of '530' '785'n cliffs m'652'es of rock '596' strewn in fantastic groupings upon '4' plain, '1' '76' of'606' disc'118' images as of '4' petrified '17'ms of '4' Levia'169' '348'ly merged in gr'652', '265' of a '768'dy '183' '448's '485' '116' in a surf of green surges.
Then, '158', in mountainous '893'ries w'43' '4' traveller is continu'34'y girdled by amp'479'h'545'rical h'879's; '43' '6' t'43' '83' '96' '672'y '378' of view '1' '76' '756' '962'ing glimpses of '4' profiles of whales de'178'd '549' '4' undulating '885's. But '1' '259' be a thorough whale'128', to '66' '182' sights; '6' '23' '146' '7', '33' if '1' '392' to re'391' to '375' a sight '158', '1' '259' be '115' '6' '101' '4' ex'735' intersecting latitude '6' '192'itude of y'119' '171' st'6'-'378', '234' so '365'-'46' '36' '375' observations of '4' hills, '7' y'119' precise, previous st'6'-'378' '72' require a laborious re-disco'131'; '46' '4' Soloma Isl'6's, '265' s'773' remain incognita, '463' '336' '530'-ruffed M'398'anna trod '116' '6' '261' Figuera chronicled '116'.

Thus at '4' North '19' I c'129'ed Levia'169' round '6' round '4' Pole '31' '4' revolutions of '4' b'40' '378's '7' '171' de'178'd '58' to me.

With a frigate's anchors '17' my bridle-'437'ts '6' fasces of harpoons '17' spurs, '72' I '87' mount '7' whale '6' leap '4' '739''344' skies, to '66' whe'4'r '4' f'473'd heavens '31' '34' '238' '893''759' '606'ts re'34'y '596' encamped beyond my mortal sight!




CHAPTER 58. Brit.

Stee'847' north-east'869'd '83' '4' Crozetts, we '947' in '31' vast meadows of brit, '4' '294', yellow substance, upon '265' '4' Right Whale largely feeds. For leagues '6' leagues it undu'399'd round us, so '7' we '562'ed to be sailing '209' bound'759' fields of ripe '6' g'261'en wh'545'.
On '4' '347' '183', '539's of Right Whales '85' '333', '94', secure '83' '4' attack of a Sperm Whaler '46' '4' Pequod, '31' '422' jaws sluggishly swam '209' '4' brit, '265', adhe'847' to '4' f'847'ing fibres of '7' wondrous Venetian blind in '238' '843's, '28' in '7' '128'ner separated '83' '4' '604' '7' escaped at '4' lip.
As '339' m'969'rs, '94' '500' by '500' slowly '6' '66''124'ly advance '238' scy'4's '209' '4' '192' wet gr'652' of marshy meads; '140' so '182' monsters swam, '380' a st'868'ge, gr'652'y, '537'ting '602'; '6' '568' '528' '116' '398''759' swaths of blue upon '4' yellow sea.*
*That '348' of '4' sea '677' among whale'508' as '4' "Brazil Banks" '185' '23' bear '7' '275' as '4' Banks of New'295'l'6' do, beca'364' of t'43' '213' sh'34'ows '6' '602'ings t'43', '33' beca'364' of '14' remark'473' meadow-'46' appea'868'ce, ca'364'd by '4' vast drifts of brit continu'34'y floating in '200' latitudes, w'43' '4' Right Whale is of'606' c'129'ed.
But it '28' '146' '4' '602' '69' '721'e as '69' '348'ed '4' brit '265' at '34' re'241'ed '63' of m'969'rs.

And as in '4' '164' hunting '893'ries of India, '4' st'868'ger at a distance '76' so'559'imes '962' on '4' plains recumbent elephants '327' kno'768'g '116' to be '375', '409' '116' '17' '960'e, '751'ened elevations of '4' soil; '140' so, of'606', '31' '58', '94' '17' '4' '171' '75' be'330's '14' species of '4' levia'169's of '4' sea. And '140' '74' recognised at '181', '238' im'508'se magnitude r'398'ers it '131' '321' re'34'y to '172' '7' '375' bulky m'652'es of '118'growth '51' '999' be instinct, in '34' '348's, '31' '4' '276' '563' of '139' '7' '349's in a '766' or a horse.
Indeed, in '173' '952's, '1' '51' '321'ly regard '138' cr'545'ures of '4' deep '31' '4' '276' '699' '7' '1' do '200' of '4' shore.

The accursed shark al'63' '51' in '138' generic '952' be '136' to bear comparative analogy to '58'.
But '463', to l'6's'508' in general, '4' native inha'437'ants of '4' seas '19' '167' '91' regarded '31' emotions un'613'ably unsocial '6' repelling; '463' we k'56' '4' sea to be an '167''181'ing terra incognita, so '7' Columbus sailed '118' '539''759' un'677' '296's to disc'118' '90' '63' superficial western '63'; '463', by vast odds, '4' '344' terrific of '34' mortal disasters '19' immemori'34'y '6' indiscriminately bef'34'en '606's '6' hund'796's of thous'6's of '200' '94' '19' g'63' upon '4' '604's; '463' '33' a mo'508't's con'500'ration '76' t'356', '7' '60''167' '231' '128' '289' brag of '90' science '6' s'320', '6' '60''167' '137', in a flatte'847' '670', '7' science '6' s'320' '289' aug'508't; '332' '17' '167' '6' '17' '167', to '4' crack of doom, '4' sea '76' insult '6' '776' '58', '6' pulverize '4' '892''596'st, stiffest frigate he '51' '106'; n'167''4''759', by '4' continual repetition of '182' '131' impressions, '128' '129' '387' '7' '587' of '4' '597' awfulness of '4' sea '265' aborigin'34'y be'192's to it.
The '171' boat we '504' of, floated on an ocean, '7' '31' Portuguese vengeance '97' whelmed a '251' '296' '327' '568' so '137' as a widow. That '276' ocean rolls '56'; '7' '276' ocean destroyed '4' wrecked ships of '181' '407'. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is '23' '332' sub'500'd; '149' thirds of '4' '807' '296' it '332' c'118's.
W'43'in differ '4' sea '6' '4' l'6', '7' a miracle upon '63' is '23' a miracle upon '4' '173'? Preternatural terrors '426'ed upon '4' Hebrews, '74' '447' '4' '908' of Korah '6' '90' '624' '4' '349' ground '422'ed '6' sw'34''969'd '116' up '17' '167'; '332' '23' a modern sun '167' '451's, '33' in precisely '4' '276' '128'ner '4' '349' sea sw'34'ows up ships '6' crews.
But '23' '146' is '4' sea '375' a foe to '128' '94' is an a'596'n to it, '33' it is '516' a fi'398' to '716' '249' '141'-sp'847'; '623' '169' '4' Persian host '94' murde'796' '90' '249' guests; spa'847' '23' '4' cr'545'ures '265' '716'elf hath spawned.

CHAPTER 59. Squid.

Slowly wading '209' '4' meadows of brit, '4' Pequod s'773' held on '49' '103' north-east'869'd to'869'ds '4' isl'6' of Java; a gentle '769' impelling '49' keel, so '7' in '4' surrounding serenity '49' '291' t'34' '890''847' masts mildly waved to '7' languid breeze, as '291' mild palms on a plain. And s'773', at wide intervals in '4' sil'131' '168', '4' l'63'ly, '34'u'847' jet '72' be '333'.
But '63' t'868'sp'36'nt blue '339', '74' a s'773'ness al'344' preternatural sp'504' '118' '4' sea, '60''167' unat'606'ded '31' '138' stagnant '804'; '74' '4' '192' burni'50'd sun-'431'e on '4' '604's '562'ed a g'261'en finger laid across '116', enjoining '96' secrecy; '74' '4' slippe'796' waves w'90'pe'796' to'42''49' as '69' softly '868' on; in '14' pro'295' hush of '4' visible sp'43' a st'868'ge spectre '28' '333' by Daggoo '83' '4' main-mast-'342'.
In '4' distance, a '164' '691' m'652' lazily rose, '6' rising '530'er '6' '530'er, '6' di'708'angling '716'elf '83' '4' azure, at '181' gleamed '165' '119' prow '46' a s'56'-slide, '212' slid '83' '4' hills. Thus g'919'ening '17' a mo'508't, as slowly it sub'500'd, '6' sank. Then '336' '117' arose, '6' silently gleamed. It '562'ed '23' a whale; '6' '332' is '14' Moby Dick? '147' Daggoo. Again '4' phantom '277' d'249', '33' on re-appea'847' '336' '117', '31' a sti'123'to-'46' cry '7' '319'led e'131' '128' '83' '90' nod, '4' negro yelled '44'—"T'43'! t'43' '158'! t'43' '50' br'356'es! '40' '531'! The W'479'e Whale, '4' W'479'e Whale!"
Upon '14', '4' sea'508' ru'50'd to '4' yard-arms, as in s'869'ming-'75' '4' bees rush to '4' boughs. B'36'-'342'ed in '4' sul'244' sun, Ahab s'111'd on '4' bowsprit, '6' '31' '63' h'6' pu'50'd '458' '528' in '504'iness to wave '90' '619's to '4' helms'128', cast '90' eager glance in '4' direction indicated aloft by '4' '44'stretched motion'759' arm of Daggoo.
Whe'4'r '4' flitting at'606''725' of '4' '63' s'773' '6' solitary jet '97' gradu'34'y '176'ed upon Ahab, so '7' he '28' '56' prepa'796' to connect '4' '256's of mildness '6' repose '31' '4' '171' sight of '4' '348'icular whale he pursued; '60''167' '14' '28', or whe'4'r '90' eagerness '592'rayed '58'; '265''167' '103' it '240' '19' '91', no '358'er '64' he distinctly perceive '4' '691' m'652', '169' '31' a quick in'606''421'y he instantly '417' '619's '17' l'969''847'.
The '492' boats '85' '358' on '4' '604'; Ahab's in advance, '6' '34' swiftly '732'ing to'869'ds '238' prey. Soon it '277' d'249', '6' '313', '31' oars susp'398'ed, we '85' a'483' '716' reappea'868'ce, lo! in '4' '276' spot w'43' it sank, '336' '117' it slowly rose. Al'344' '353'ting '17' '4' mo'508't '34' '147's of Moby Dick, we '56' gazed at '4' '344' wondrous pheno'508'on '265' '4' '669' seas '19' '479''49'to revealed to '128''207'. A vast pulpy m'652', fur'192's in length '6' b'504'th, of a glancing cream-col'119', lay floating on '4' '604', innumer'473' '192' arms radiating '83' '716' centre, '6' curling '6' twisting '46' a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at '138' hap'759' object '31'in r'356'. No perceptible '352' or '569' '64' it '19'; no c'336'iv'473' token of ei'4'r sensation or instinct; '33' undu'399'd t'43' on '4' '899'ows, an un'987'ly, '17'm'759', '365'-'46' apparition of '139'.
As '31' a low sucking '602' it slowly disappea'796' '158', Starbuck s'773' gazing at '4' agitated '604's w'43' it '97' sunk, '31' a wild '915' exclaimed—"Al'344' '743' '97' I '333' Moby Dick '6' fought '58', '169' to '19' '333' '4'e, thou '691' ghost!"
"What '28' it, Sir?" '136' Fl'257'.
"The '164' '349' squid, '265', '69' '99', '360' whale-ships '167' beheld, '6' re'391'ed to '238' ports to '81' of it."
But Ahab '136' no'124'; '391'ing '90' boat, he sailed '78' to '4' vessel; '4' '426' as silently '858'ing.
W'413'ver superstitions '4' sperm whale'508' in general '19' connected '31' '4' sight of '14' object, '979' it is, '7' a glimpse of it '213' so '131' unusual, '7' circumstance '129' g'63' '458' to invest it '31' por'606'tousness. So r'36'ly is it beheld, '7' '463' '63' '6' '34' of '116' decl'36' it to be '4' largest animated '124' in '4' ocean, '332' '131' '360' of '116' '19' '138' '33' '4' '344' vague '256's c'336'rning '716' '354' nature '6' '17'm; '23''31'st'6'ing, '69' '172' it to furnish to '4' sperm whale '90' '146' '696'. For '463' '173' species of whales '156' '238' '696' above '604', '6' '289' be '333' by '128' in '4' '735' of feeding, '4' spermaceti whale obtains '90' '251' '696' in un'677' z'913' below '4' sur'352'; '6' '146' by inference is it '7' '138' '63' '51' '81' of '11', precisely, '7' '696' consists. At '464', '74' '452'ly pursued, he '76' disgorge '11' '36' '340' to be '4' detached arms of '4' squid; '96' of '116' thus exhi'437'ed exceeding t'277'y '6' thirty '908' in length. T'84' fancy '7' '4' monster to '265' '182' arms be'192'ed ordinarily clings by '116' to '4' '515' of '4' ocean; '6' '7' '4' sperm whale, un'46' '173' species, is supp'596'd '31' teeth in '619' to attack '6' tear it.
T'43' '562's '96' ground to '805' '7' '4' '164' Kraken of Bishop Pon'739'podan '289' ultimately resolve '716'elf '155' Squid. The '128'ner in '265' '4' Bishop describes it, as alternately rising '6' sinking, '31' '96' '173' '348'iculars he narrates, in '34' '14' '4' '149' correspond. But '137' abate'508't is necessary '31' '952' to '4' inc'796'ible bulk he as'659's it.
By '96' natura'919's '94' '19' vaguely '299' rumors of '4' mysterious cr'545'ure, '43' spoken of, it is included among '4' cl'652' of '537'tle-fish, to '265', indeed, in '979' external '952's it '72' '562' to be'192', '33' '146' as '4' Anak of '4' tribe.




CHAPTER 60. The Line.

With reference to '4' whaling scene '940'ly to be descri'515', as '35' as '17' '4' '166' '447'st'6'ing of '34' similar scenes '234'w'43' '986'ed, I '19' '43' to '613' of '4' magical, so'559'imes horrible whale-'518'.
The '518' origin'34'y '364'd in '4' fi'50'ry '28' of '4' '258' hemp, s'703'ly vap'119'ed '31' tar, '23' impregnated '31' it, as in '4' '390' of ordinary ropes; '17' '313' tar, as ordinarily '364'd, '408' '4' hemp '117' pli'473' to '4' rope-'106'r, '6' '516' r'398'ers '4' rope '716'elf '117' convenient to '4' sailor '17' common ship '364'; '332', '23' '146' '72' '4' ordinary quantity '111' '137' stiffen '4' whale-'518' '17' '4' '452' coiling to '265' it '259' be subjected; '33' as '344' sea'508' '36' beginning to '819', tar in general by no '410' adds to '4' rope's durability or strength, '60''167' '137' it '289' '145' it comp'735'ness '6' gloss.
Of '399' '266' '4' Manilla rope '129' in '4' Ameri'51' fi'50'ry al'344' '797'ly superseded hemp as a material '17' whale-'518's; '17', '463' '23' so dur'473' as hemp, it is '777'er, '6' '458' '117' soft '6' e'181'ic; '6' I '76' add ('317' t'43' is an aes'4'tics in '34' '124's), is '137' '117' '524'ome '6' be'260' to '4' boat, '169' hemp. Hemp is a dusky, '967' '947'ow, a '563' of Indian; '33' Manilla is as a g'261'en-hai'796' Circ'652'ian to be'330'.
The whale-'518' is '146' '149'-thirds of an inch in thickness. At '171' sight, '1' '72' '23' '54' it so '777' as it re'34'y is. By experi'508't '716' '63' '6' fifty yarns '76' '356' susp'398' a w'879' of '63' hund'796' '6' t'277'y pounds; so '7' '4' '251' rope '76' bear a strain '958'ly equal to '291' tons. In length, '4' common sperm whale-'518' mea'115's so'559'hing '118' '149' hund'796' fathoms. To'869'ds '4' stern of '4' boat it is spir'34'y coiled '170' in '4' tub, '23' '46' '4' worm-pipe of a s'773' '463', '33' so as to '17'm '63' round, cheese-shaped m'652' of densely '515'ded "'50'aves," or layers of c'336'ntric spiralizations, '327' '138' hollow '33' '4' "'374'," or '294' vertical tube '17'med at '4' axis of '4' cheese.

In '4' English boats '149' tubs '36' '364'd '861' of '63'; '4' '276' '518' '213' continuously coiled in '312' tubs. T'43' is '96' advantage in '14'; beca'364' '182' t'768'-tubs '213' so sm'34' '69' fit '117' '504'ily '155' '4' boat, '6' do '23' strain it so '137'; w'43'as, '4' Ameri'51' tub, '958'ly '291' '908' in dia'559'er '6' of proportionate depth, '408' a '743' bulky fr'879' '17' a craft '94'se '519'ks '36' '33' '63' '499'-inch in thickness; '17' '4' bottom of '4' whale-boat is '46' critical '972', '265' '76' bear up a con'500'r'473' distri'33'ed w'879', '33' '23' '131' '137' of a c'336'ntrated '63'. When '4' '684'ted '51'vas c'118' is clapped on '4' Ameri'51' '518'-tub, '4' boat '388' as if it '85' '732'ing '141' '31' a prodigious '164' '471'-cake to '986' to '4' whales.
Both '398's of '4' '518' '36' exposed; '4' l'969'r '398' terminating in an '784'-spl'972' or loop '260' up '83' '4' bottom '485' '4' '500' of '4' tub, '6' '621'ing '118' '716' edge comp'123'ely disengaged '83' e'131''124'. T'90' ar'868'ge'508't of '4' l'969'r '398' is necessary on '149' ac'893's. First: In '619' to facilitate '4' fas'606'ing to it of an additional '518' '83' a neighbo'847' boat, in '390' '4' stricken whale '134' '602' so deep as to threa'606' to '324'ry '141' '4' '797' '518' origin'34'y attached to '4' harpoon. In '182' instances, '4' whale of '239' is shifted '46' a mug of ale, as it '85', '83' '4' '63' boat to '4' '173'; '463' '4' '171' boat '194' h'118's at h'6' to '652'ist '716' con'563'. Second: T'90' ar'868'ge'508't is indispens'473' '17' common '564'ty's '997'; '17' '85' '4' l'969'r '398' of '4' '518' in '138' '103' attached to '4' boat, '6' '85' '4' whale '98' to '366' '4' '518' '44' to '4' '398' al'344' in a single, smoking '294' as he so'559'imes '185', he '72' '23' '188' t'43', '17' '4' doomed boat '72' inf'34'ibly be dragged d'249' '180' '58' '155' '4' pro'427'dity of '4' sea; '6' in '7' '390' no t'249'-crier '72' '167' '156' '49' '158'.
Be'17'e l'969''847' '4' boat '17' '4' c'129'e, '4' upper '398' of '4' '518' is '645' aft '83' '4' tub, '6' '962'ing round '4' logger'342' t'43', is '158' '324'ried '17''869'd '4' '797' length of '4' boat, '426'ing crosswise upon '4' loom or '627' of e'131' '128''s oar, so '7' it jogs '485' '90' wrist in ro'768'g; '6' '516' '962'ing '592'ween '4' '508', as '69' alternately '421' at '4' oppo'421'e '723'wales, to '4' leaded chocks or grooves in '4' extreme '378'ed prow of '4' boat, w'43' a wooden pin or skewer '4' size of a common quill, pr'140'ts it '83' slipping '44'. From '4' chocks it '621's in a s'703' fes'111'n '118' '4' bows, '6' is '98' '962'ed in'500' '4' boat '158'; '6' '96' '606' or t'277'y fathoms (c'34'ed '990'-'518') '213' coiled upon '4' '990' in '4' bows, it continues '716' '103' to '4' '723'wale s'773' a '105' fur'4'r aft, '6' is '98' attached to '4' '940'-'869'p—'4' rope '265' is immediately connected '31' '4' harpoon; '33' previous to '7' connexion, '4' '940'-'869'p '547' '209' sundry mystifications '111' tedious to detail.
Thus '4' whale-'518' f'261's '4' '251' boat in '716' complicated coils, twisting '6' wri'124' '187' it in al'344' e'131' direction. All '4' oars'508' '36' '745' in '716' perilous contortions; so '7' to '4' timid '784' of '4' l'6's'128', '69' '562' as Indian jugglers, '31' '4' '314''596'st snakes sportively fes'111'ning '238' limbs. Nor '51' '138' '273' of mortal '263', '17' '4' '171' '75', s'545' '58''968' amid '200' hempen intricacies, '6' '313' straining '90' ut'344' at '4' oar, be'54' '58' '7' at '138' un'677' instant '4' harpoon '289' be darted, '6' '34' '182' horrible contortions be '186' in '412' '46' '847'ed '703'nings; he '51''23' be thus circumstanced '327' a shudder '7' '408' '4' '131' marrow in '90' b'913' to quiver in '58' '46' a shaken jelly. Yet ha'437'—st'868'ge '124'! '11' '51''23' ha'437' accomplish?—Gayer s'34'ies, '117' merry mirth, '166' jokes, '6' b'40'er re'348'ees, '1' n'167' '299' '118' y'119' mahog'138', '169' '1' '76' '230' '118' '4' '499'-inch '691' cedar of '4' whale-boat, '74' thus hung in '621''128''s nooses; '6', '46' '4' '578' burg'49's of Calais '165' King Ed'869'd, '4' '578' '508' composing '4' crew '732' '155' '4' jaws of '548', '31' a halter '187' e'131' neck, as '1' '289' '99'.
Perhaps a '131' '105' '147' '76' '56' en'473' '1' to ac'893' '17' '200' rep'545'ed whaling disasters—'96' '360' of '265' '36' casu'34'y chronicled—of '14' '128' or '7' '128' '213' '645' '44' of '4' boat by '4' '518', '6' '387'. For, '74' '4' '518' is darting '44', to be s'545'ed '98' in '4' boat, is '46' '213' s'545'ed in '4' midst of '4' '128'if'261' whizzings of a s'851'-engine in '597' '412', '74' e'131' f'666' beam, '6' shaft, '6' wheel, is grazing '1'. It is '623'; '17' '1' '51''23' '421' motion'759' in '4' '374' of '182' perils, beca'364' '4' boat is rocking '46' a cradle, '6' '1' '36' pitched '63' '103' '6' '4' '173', '327' '4' s'703'est '869'ning; '6' '146' by a '979' '968'-ad'22'ing buoyancy '6' simultaneousness of volition '6' '735'ion, '51' '1' escape '213' '721'e a Mazeppa of, '6' '366' '170' '31' w'43' '4' '34'-'66'ing sun '58''968' '87' n'167' pierce '1' '44'.
Again: as '4' pro'295' '804' '265' '146' app'36'ntly precedes '6' prophesies of '4' storm, is '760' '117' awful '169' '4' storm '716'elf; '17', indeed, '4' '804' is '33' '4' wrapper '6' envelope of '4' storm; '6' contains it in '716'elf, as '4' '562'ingly harm'759' rifle '330's '4' fatal powder, '6' '4' b'34', '6' '4' explosion; so '4' graceful repose of '4' '518', as it silently serpentines '39' '4' oars'508' '165' '213' '561' '155' '735'ual '412'—'14' is a '124' '265' '324'ries '117' of '354' terror '169' '138' '173' aspect of '14' dangerous af'807'. But '65' '99' '117'? All '508' '349' enveloped in whale-'518's. All '36' born '31' halters round '238' necks; '33' it is '146' '74' '808' in '4' swift, sudden '391' of '548', '7' mortals '635' '4' silent, subtle, '167'-'986' perils of '139'. And if '1' be a philosop'49', '463' s'545'ed in '4' whale-boat, '1' '72' '23' at '374' '174' '63' w'479' '117' of terror, '169' '463' s'545'ed '165' y'119' '140'ing '522' '31' a poker, '6' '23' a harpoon, by y'119' '500'.




CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.

If to Starbuck '4' apparition of '4' Squid '28' a '124' of por'606'ts, to Queequeg it '28' '538' a '465' object.
"When '1' '66' '58' 'quid," '136' '4' savage, honing '90' harpoon in '4' bow of '90' hoisted boat, "'98' '1' quick '66' '58' 'parm whale."
The '290' '183' '28' exceedingly s'773' '6' sul'244', '6' '31' no'124' '591' to engage '116', '4' Pequod's crew '87' '321'ly resist '4' spell of '503' induced by '375' a va'51't sea. For '14' '348' of '4' Indian Ocean '209' '265' we '98' '85' voyaging is '23' '11' whale'508' c'34' a '349'ly ground; '7' is, it af'17'ds '360'er glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, f'666'-fish, '6' '173' vivacious denizens of '117' stir'847' '604's, '169' '200' '141' '4' Rio de la Plata, or '4' in-shore ground '141' Peru.
It '28' my '391' to st'6' at '4' '17'emast-'342'; '6' '31' my '134'ers leaning '485' '4' slackened royal shrouds, to '6' fro I idly s'103'ed in '11' '562'ed an enchanted '769'. No resolution '87' '31'st'6' it; in '7' '710'y mood losing '34' consciousness, at '181' my soul '277' '44' of my '618'; '463' my '618' s'773' continued to s'103' as a p'398'ulum '76', '192' '180' '4' '637' '265' '171' '367'd it is '31'drawn.
Ere '353'fulness alto'42''49' '246' '118' me, I '97' '23''972'd '7' '4' sea'508' at '4' main '6' mizzen-mast-'342's '85' '287' drowsy. So '7' at '181' '34' '291' of us '139''759'ly swung '83' '4' spars, '6' '17' e'131' s'768'g '7' we '721'e t'43' '28' a nod '83' below '83' '4' slumbe'847' helms'128'. The waves, '111', nodded '238' indolent c'426's; '6' across '4' wide t'868'ce of '4' sea, east nodded to west, '6' '4' sun '118' '34'.
Suddenly bubbles '562'ed bursting ben'545'h my '452'd '495'; '46' v'972's my '524' grasped '4' shrouds; '96' invisible, gracious agency preserved me; '31' a shock I '246' '78' to '139'. And lo! '452' '447' '119' lee, '23' '17'ty fathoms '141', a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in '4' '604' '46' '4' capsized hull of a frigate, '90' b'937', glossy '78', of an Ethiopian hue, g'919'ening in '4' sun's rays '46' a mirror. But lazily undulating in '4' trough of '4' sea, '6' '167' '6' anon t'868'quilly sp'44'ing '90' vap'119'y jet, '4' whale '720' '46' a portly burg'49' smoking '90' pipe of a '869'm '180'noon. But '7' pipe, '719' whale, '28' thy '181'. As if struck by '96' enchanter's w'6', '4' '503'y ship '6' e'131' '503'er in it '34' at '336' '319'ed '155' '830'fulness; '6' '117' '169' a score of '915's '83' '34' '348's of '4' vessel, simultaneously '31' '4' '291' '23'es '83' aloft, sh'44'ed '17'th '4' accustomed cry, as '4' '164' fish slowly '6' regularly sp'44'ed '4' sparkling brine '155' '4' '769'.
"Clear '170' '4' boats! Luff!" cried Ahab. And obeying '90' '249' '619', he da'50'd '4' helm d'249' '165' '4' helms'128' '87' '627' '4' spokes.
The sudden exclamations of '4' crew '259' '19' alarmed '4' whale; '6' ere '4' boats '85' d'249', majestic'34'y '391'ing, he swam '170' to '4' lee'869'd, '33' '31' '375' a steady t'868'quillity, '6' '380' so '360' ripples as he swam, '7' '54'ing '180' '34' he '240' '23' as '332' be alarmed, Ahab '417' '619's '7' '23' an oar '134' be '364'd, '6' no '128' '259' '613' '33' in w'90'pers. So s'545'ed '46' Ontario Indians on '4' '723'wales of '4' boats, we swiftly '33' silently paddled '549'; '4' '804' '23' '774'ting of '4' noise'759' sails '213' '451'. Pre'708'ly, as we thus glided in c'129'e, '4' monster perp'398'icularly flitted '90' tail '17'ty '908' '155' '4' '769', '6' '98' sank '44' of sight '46' a t'969'r sw'34''969'd up.
"T'43' go flukes!" '28' '4' cry, an announce'508't immediately '858'ed by Stubb's producing '90' match '6' igniting '90' pipe, '17' '56' a respite '28' g'868'ted. After '4' '597' interval of '90' '602'ing '97' elapsed, '4' whale rose '158', '6' '213' '56' in advance of '4' smoker's boat, '6' '137' '958'er to it '169' to '138' of '4' '173's, Stubb '893'ed upon '4' hon'119' of '4' capture. It '28' obvious, '56', '7' '4' whale '97' at length be'67' aw'36' of '90' pursuers. All silence of cautiousness '28' t'43''17'e no '192'er of '364'. Paddles '85' '705'ped, '6' oars '246' loudly '155' '412'. And s'773' puffing at '90' pipe, Stubb chee'796' on '90' crew to '4' '652'ault.
Yes, a '240'y '397' '97' '67' '118' '4' fish. All a'349' to '90' jeopardy, he '28' '45' "'342' '44'"; '7' '348' obliquely projecting '83' '4' '721' yeast '265' he brewed.*
*It '76' be '333' in '96' '173' '226' of '11' a '131' '703' substance '4' '797' interior of '4' sperm whale's enormous '342' consists. Though app'36'ntly '4' '344' m'652'ive, it is by '458' '4' '344' buoyant '348' '39' '58'. So '7' '31' ease he elevates it in '4' '769', '6' invariably '185' so '74' '45' at '90' ut'344' speed. Be'500's, '375' is '4' b'504'th of '4' upper '348' of '4' '569' of '90' '342', '6' '375' '4' '890''847' '537'-'604' '17'mation of '4' l'969'r '348', '7' by obliquely elevating '90' '342', he t'43'by '289' be '136' to t'868's'17'm '58''968' '83' a bluff-b'969'd sluggish g'34'iot '155' a sharp'378'ed New '826' pi'202'-boat.
"Start '49', '319' '49', my '508'! Don't '906' y'119'selves; '101' plenty of '75'—'33' '319' '49'; '319' '49' '46' th'447'-claps, '55' '34'," cried Stubb, splutte'847' '44' '4' smoke as he spoke. "Start '49', '56'; '145' '514' '4' '192' '6' '777' stroke, Tashtego. Start '49', Tash, my '311'—'319' '49', '34'; '33' '184' '494', '184' '494'—cucumbers is '4' '429'—'454', '454'—'146' '319' '49' '46' grim '548' '6' grinning d'779's, '6' raise '4' buried '314' perp'398'icular '44' of '238' graves, '311's—'55' '34'. Start '49'!"
"Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!" screamed '4' Gay-Header in reply, raising '96' '261' '869'-'94'op to '4' skies; as e'131' oars'128' in '4' strained boat involuntarily bounced '17''869'd '31' '4' '63' tre'508'dous leading stroke '265' '4' eager Indian '417'.
But '90' wild screams '85' '491'ed by '173's '538' as wild. "Kee-hee! Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining '17''869'ds '6' '78''869'ds on '90' s'545', '46' a pacing tiger in '90' cage.
"Ka-la! Koo-loo!" '60'led Queequeg, as if smacking '90' lips '118' a '843'ful of Grena'474'r's steak. And thus '31' oars '6' yells '4' keels '537' '4' sea. Mean'313', Stubb retaining '90' '226' in '4' van, s'773' enc'119'aged '90' '508' to '4' on'451', '34' '4' '313' puffing '4' smoke '83' '90' '843'. Like despera'185' '69' tugged '6' '69' strained, '773' '4' wel'67' cry '28' '299'—"St'6' up, Tashtego!—'145' it to '58'!" The harpoon '28' hurled. "Stern '34'!" The oars'508' '78'ed '604'; '4' '276' mo'508't so'559'hing '277' '576' '6' '90'sing '549' e'131' '63' of '238' wrists. It '28' '4' magical '518'. An instant '165', Stubb '97' swiftly '808' '149' additional '391's '31' it round '4' logger'342', '74'ce, by '385' of '716' increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke '56' jetted up '6' mingled '31' '4' steady fumes '83' '90' pipe. As '4' '518' '962'ed round '6' round '4' logger'342'; so '516', '22' '165' r'356'ing '7' '378', it b'919'e'847'ly '962'ed '209' '6' '209' '312' of Stubb's '524', '83' '265' '4' h'6'-c'202'hs, or squ'36's of quilted '51'vas so'559'imes worn at '182' '464', '97' '829''34'y '705'ped. It '28' '46' '956' an enemy's sharp '149'-edged s'429' by '4' blade, '6' '7' enemy '34' '4' '75' striving to w'426' it '44' of y'119' clutch.
"Wet '4' '518'! wet '4' '518'!" cried Stubb to '4' tub oars'128' ('58' s'545'ed by '4' tub) '94', snatching '141' '90' hat, da'50'd sea-'604' '155' it.* More '391's '85' '645', so '7' '4' '518' began '956' '716' '226'. The boat '56' flew '209' '4' boiling '604' '46' a shark '34' fins. Stubb '6' Tashtego '43' '397'd '226's—stem '17' stern—a stagge'847' '355' truly in '7' rocking commotion.
*Partly to s'60' '4' indispens'473'ness of '14' '735', it '289' '43' be '892'd, '7', in '4' '261' Dutch fi'50'ry, a mop '28' '364'd to dash '4' '573' '518' '31' '604'; in '128'y '173' ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is '451' a'348' '17' '7' purpose. Y'119' hat, '60''167', is '4' '344' convenient.
From '4' vibrating '518' ex'606'ding '4' '797' length of '4' upper '348' of '4' boat, '6' '83' '716' '56' '213' '117' tight '169' a harpst'847', '1' '72' '19' '147' '4' craft '97' '149' keels—'63' c'568' '4' '604', '4' '173' '4' '769'—as '4' boat churned on '209' '312' opposing ele'508'ts at '336'. A continual cascade '412'ed at '4' bows; a cease'759' whirling eddy in '49' '830'; '6', at '4' s'703'est motion '83' '31'in, '140' '33' of a '105' finger, '4' vibrating, cracking craft '51'ted '118' '49' spasmodic '723'wale '155' '4' sea. Thus '69' ru'50'd; '356' '128' '31' '240' '6' main clinging to '90' s'545', to pr'140't '213' tossed to '4' foam; '6' '4' t'34' '17'm of Tashtego at '4' stee'847' oar crouching al'344' double, in '619' to b'847' d'249' '90' centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics '6' Pacifics '562'ed '962'ed as '69' s'576' on '238' '103', '773' at length '4' whale '96''11' slackened '90' f'703'.
"Haul in—haul in!" cried Stubb to '4' bows'128'! '6', facing round to'869'ds '4' whale, '34' '524' began '732'ing '4' boat up to '58', '313' '332' '4' boat '28' '213' t'969'd on. Soon '868'ging up by '90' flank, Stubb, firmly '519'ting '90' knee in '4' clumsy cl'545', darted dart '180' dart '155' '4' f'666' fish; at '4' '429' of com'128'd, '4' boat alternately sterning '44' of '4' '103' of '4' whale's horrible w'34'ow, '6' '98' '868'ging up '17' an'173' fling.
The '796' tide '56' p'119'ed '83' '34' '500's of '4' monster '46' brooks d'249' a hill. His tor'508'ted '618' rolled '23' in brine '33' in '593', '265' bubbled '6' '66''4'd '17' fur'192's '528' in '238' '830'. The slanting sun '657' upon '14' crim'273' pond in '4' sea, '708' '78' '716' reflection '155' e'131' '352', so '7' '69' '34' gl'969'd to '356' '173' '46' '796' '508'. And '34' '4' '313', jet '180' jet of '691' smoke '28' '414'nizingly s'576' '83' '4' spiracle of '4' whale, '6' vehe'508't puff '180' puff '83' '4' '843' of '4' excited '342's'128'; as at e'131' dart, hauling in upon '90' crooked lance (by '4' '518' attached to it), Stubb straigh'606'ed it '158' '6' '158', by a '360' rapid blows '485' '4' '723'wale, '98' '158' '6' '158' '708' it '155' '4' whale.
"Pull up—'732' up!" he '56' cried to '4' bows'128', as '4' waning whale '825'ed in '90' wrath. "Pull up!—'452' to!" '6' '4' boat '868'ged '549' '4' fish's flank. When r'356'ing '458' '118' '4' bow, Stubb slowly churned '90' '192' sharp lance '155' '4' fish, '6' '764' it t'43', '324'e'597'y churning '6' churning, as if cautiously '66'king to '174' '180' '96' g'261' '430' '7' '4' whale '240' '19' sw'34''969'd, '6' '265' he '28' fearful of '448'ing ere he '87' hook it '44'. But '7' g'261' '430' he sought '28' '4' inner'344' '139' of '4' fish. And '56' it is struck; '17', '319'ing '83' '90' t'868'ce '155' '7' un'613''473' '124' c'34'ed '90' "flurry," '4' monster horribly w'34''969'd in '90' '593', '118'wrapped '58''968' in impenetr'473', '721', boiling spray, so '7' '4' imperilled craft, instantly '705'ping astern, '97' '137' ado blindly to struggle '44' '83' '7' phrensied twi'703' '155' '4' '574' '769' of '4' '183'.
And '56' abating in '90' flurry, '4' whale '336' '117' rolled '44' '155' view; surging '83' '500' to '500'; spasmodic'34'y dilating '6' contr'735'ing '90' sp'44'-hole, '31' sharp, cracking, '414'nized respirations. At '181', gush '180' gush of c'202'ted '796' gore, as if it '97' '91' '4' purple lees of '796' '768'e, s'576' '155' '4' f'40'ed '769'; '6' f'34'ing '78' '158', '868' dripping d'249' '90' motion'759' flanks '155' '4' sea. His '374' '97' burst!
"He's '314', '197' Stubb," '136' Daggoo.
"Yes; '312' pipes smoked '44'!" '6' '31'dra'768'g '90' '249' '83' '90' '843', Stubb scatte'796' '4' '314' a'50's '118' '4' '604'; '6', '17' a mo'508't, s'111'd '147''597'y '784'ing '4' vast corpse he '97' '721'e.




CHAPTER 62. The Dart.

A '429' c'336'rning an incident in '4' '181' chapter.
According to '4' invari'473' usage of '4' fi'50'ry, '4' whale-boat pu'50's '141' '83' '4' ship, '31' '4' '342's'128' or whale-'320'er as temporary steers'128', '6' '4' harpo'63'er or whale-fas'606'er '732'ing '4' '17'e'344' oar, '4' '63' '677' as '4' harpo'63'er-oar. Now it '460' a '777', nervous arm to strike '4' '171' iron '155' '4' fish; '17' of'606', in '11' is c'34'ed a '192' dart, '4' heavy imple'508't '129' to be flung to '4' distance of t'277'y or thirty '908'. But '60''167' pro'192'ed '6' exhausting '4' c'129'e, '4' harpo'63'er is '741'ed to '732' '90' oar '80''313' to '4' utter'344'; indeed, he is '741'ed to '451' an example of superhu'128' '735'ivity to '4' '426', '23' '146' by inc'796'ible ro'768'g, '33' by rep'545'ed loud '6' intrepid exclamations; '6' '11' it is to '184' sh'44'ing at '4' '739' of '63''s com'962', '313' '34' '4' '173' muscles '36' strained '6' '499' '319'ed—'11' '7' is '697' k'56' '33' '200' '94' '19' '457' it. For '63', I '51''23' bawl '131' '374'ily '6' '176' '131' reck'759'ly at '63' '6' '4' '276' '75'. In '14' straining, bawling '892', '98', '31' '90' '78' to '4' fish, '34' at '336' '4' exhausted harpo'63'er '230's '4' exciting cry—"St'6' up, '6' '145' it to '58'!" He '56' '129' to '705' '6' secure '90' oar, '391' round on '90' centre '499' '103', seize '90' harpoon '83' '4' crotch, '6' '31' '11' '105' strength '289' remain, he es'415' to pitch it '96''60' '155' '4' whale. No '683', '409' '4' '251' fleet of whale'508' in a '618', '7' '44' of fifty '807' '365's '17' a dart, '23' '401' '36' successful; no '683' '7' so '128'y hap'759' harpo'63'ers '36' '721'ly cursed '6' disrated; no '683' '7' '96' of '116' '735'u'34'y burst '238' '593'-vessels in '4' boat; no '683' '7' '96' sperm whale'508' '36' ab'708' '492' '266' '31' '492' '960'rels; no '683' '7' to '128'y ship '249'ers, whaling is '33' a losing c'336'rn; '17' it is '4' harpo'63'er '7' '408' '4' voyage, '6' if '1' '101' '4' br'545'h '44' of '90' '618' '60' '51' '1' '741' to '156' it t'43' '74' '344' '53'ed!
Again, if '4' dart be successful, '98' at '4' '347' critical instant, '7' is, '74' '4' whale '319's to '366', '4' boa'4'ader '6' harpo'63'er '46'wise '319' to '573' '17'e '6' aft, to '4' im'462'nt jeopardy of '116'selves '6' e'131' '63' '234'. It is '98' '69' '397' '226's; '6' '4' '342's'128', '4' chief '493'r of '4' '105' craft, '726' '90' proper station in '4' bows of '4' boat.
Now, I '324'e '23' '94' maintains '4' contrary, '33' '34' '14' is '312' foolish '6' unnecessary. The '342's'128' '134' '235' in '4' bows '83' '171' to '181'; he '134' '312' dart '4' harpoon '6' '4' lance, '6' no ro'768'g w'413'ver '134' be '741'ed of '58', '722' '447' circumstances obvious to '138' fi'50'r'128'. I k'56' '7' '14' '72' so'559'imes involve a s'703' loss of speed in '4' c'129'e; '33' '192' experience in various whale'508' of '117' '169' '63' nation '129' convinced me '7' in '4' vast majority of failures in '4' fi'50'ry, it '129' '23' by '138' '410' '91' so '137' '4' speed of '4' whale as '4' '165' descri'515' exhaustion of '4' harpo'63'er '7' '129' ca'364'd '116'.
To in'115' '4' '164'est efficiency in '4' dart, '4' harpo'63'ers of '14' '296' '259' '319' to '238' '908' '83' '44' of idleness, '6' '23' '83' '44' of toil.




CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.

Out of '4' t'366'k, '4' b'868'ches grow; '44' of '116', '4' twigs. So, in productive subjects, grow '4' chapters.
The crotch '34'uded to on a previous page '922's indep'398'ent '508'tion. It is a '23'ched '856' of a peculiar '17'm, '96' '149' '908' in length, '265' is perp'398'icularly inserted '155' '4' starboard '723'wale '958' '4' bow, '17' '4' purpose of furnishing a '426' '17' '4' wooden extremity of '4' harpoon, '94'se '173' naked, '960''515' '398' slopingly projects '83' '4' prow. T'43'by '4' weapon is instantly at h'6' to '716' hurler, '94' snatches it up as '504'ily '83' '716' '426' as a '78'woods'128' s'768'gs '90' rifle '83' '4' w'34'. It is customary to '19' '149' harpoons reposing in '4' crotch, '952'ively c'34'ed '4' '171' '6' '347' irons.
But '182' '149' harpoons, '356' by '716' '249' cord, '36' '312' connected '31' '4' '518'; '4' object '213' '14': to dart '116' '312', if '622', '63' instantly '180' '4' '173' '155' '4' '276' whale; so '7' if, in '4' '260' drag, '63' '134' draw '44', '4' '173' '289' s'773' retain a '330'. It is a doubling of '4' '365's. But it '131' of'606' '308's '7' o'768'g to '4' instantaneous, violent, convulsive '573' of '4' whale upon receiving '4' '171' iron, it be'67's im'622' '17' '4' harpo'63'er, '60''167' '703'ning-'46' in '90' '367''508'ts, to pitch '4' '347' iron '155' '58'. N'167''4''759', as '4' '347' iron is '287' connected '31' '4' '518', '6' '4' '518' is '573', hence '7' weapon '259', at '34' '140'ts, be anticipatingly tossed '44' of '4' boat, '96''60' '6' '96'w'43'; '234' '4' '344' '816' jeopardy '72' involve '34' '524'. Tumbled '155' '4' '604', it accordingly is in '375' '390's; '4' sp'36' coils of '990' '518' ('508'ti'63'd in a preceding chapter) '380' '14' f'545', in '344' instances, prudently pr'735'ic'473'. But '14' critical '735' is '23' '194' unat'606'ded '31' '4' saddest '6' '344' fatal casualties.
Fur'4'r'117': '1' '259' k'56' '7' '74' '4' '347' iron is '687'n '118'board, it '98'ce'17'th be'67's a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly curvetting '39' '312' boat '6' whale, entangling '4' '518's, or '537'ting '116', '6' '380' a prodigious sensation in '34' directions. Nor, in general, is it '622' to secure it '158' '326' '4' whale is '807'ly captu'796' '6' a corpse.
Con'500'r, '56', '60' it '259' be in '4' '390' of '492' boats '34' engaging '63' unusu'34'y '777', '735'ive, '6' kno'768'g whale; '74' o'768'g to '182' qualities in '58', as '35' as to '4' thous'6' concur'847' '829's of '375' an audacious enterprise, '879' or '606' loose '347' irons '289' be simultaneously dangling '39' '58'. For, of '239', '356' boat is supp'596'd '31' s'167'al harpoons to b'398' on to '4' '518' '134' '4' '171' '63' be ineffectu'34'y darted '327' reco'131'. All '182' '348'iculars '36' faith'597'y narrated '43', as '69' '76' '23' fail to eluci'517' s'167'al '344' '425', '60''167' intricate '962'ages, in scenes '43''180' to be '684'ted.




CHAPTER 64. Stubb's Supper.

Stubb's whale '97' '91' '466' '96' distance '83' '4' ship. It '28' a '804'; so, '17'ming a t'6'em of '291' boats, we com'508'ced '4' slow '355' of to'768'g '4' trophy to '4' Pequod. And '56', as we '879'een '508' '31' '119' thirty-'578' arms, '6' '63' hund'796' '6' '879'y thumbs '6' fingers, slowly toiled '612' '180' '612' upon '7' inert, sluggish corpse in '4' sea; '6' it '562'ed '321'ly to budge at '34', '722' at '192' intervals; '68' '923' '28' '43'by furni'50'd of '4' enormousness of '4' m'652' we '367'd. For, upon '4' '164' '51'al of Hang-Ho, or w'413'ver '69' c'34' it, in China, '492' or '401' laborers on '4' foot-path '76' draw a bulky fr'879'ed junk at '4' rate of a mile an '612'; '33' '14' gr'6' argosy we t'969'd heavily '17'ged '549', as if laden '31' pig-lead in bulk.
Darkness '246' on; '33' '291' '703's up '6' d'249' in '4' Pequod's main-rigging dimly guided '119' '103'; '773' dra'768'g '958'er we '282' Ahab '705'ping '63' of s'167'al '117' lanterns '118' '4' bul'869'ks. Va'51'tly '784'ing '4' heaving whale '17' a mo'508't, he issued '4' usual '619's '17' secu'847' it '17' '4' '168', '6' '98' h'6'ing '90' lantern to a sea'128', '277' '90' '103' '155' '4' cabin, '6' '64' '23' '67' '17''869'd '158' '326' '339'.
Though, in '118''66'ing '4' pursuit of '14' whale, Captain Ahab '97' evinced '90' customary '735'ivity, to c'34' it so; '332' '56' '7' '4' cr'545'ure '28' '314', '96' vague dissatis'418'ion, or impatience, or desp'769', '562'ed '406' in '58'; as if '4' sight of '7' '314' '618' re'241'ed '58' '7' Moby Dick '28' '332' to be slain; '6' '463' a thous'6' '173' whales '85' '561' to '90' ship, '34' '7' '72' '23' '63' jot advance '90' gr'6', mono'128'iac object. Very '358' '1' '72' '19' '147' '83' '4' '602' on '4' Pequod's decks, '7' '34' '524' '85' prepa'847' to cast anchor in '4' deep; '17' heavy chains '36' '213' dragged '549' '4' deck, '6' thrust rattling '44' of '4' port-holes. But by '200' clanking links, '4' vast corpse '716'elf, '23' '4' ship, is to be moo'796'. Tied by '4' '342' to '4' stern, '6' by '4' tail to '4' bows, '4' whale '56' '596's '31' '716' '751' hull '452' to '4' vessel's '6' '333' '209' '4' '967'ness of '4' '168', '265' obscu'796' '4' spars '6' rigging aloft, '4' '149'—ship '6' whale, '562'ed yoked to'42''49' '46' colossal bullocks, w'43'of '63' rec'518's '313' '4' '173' remains st'6'ing.*
*A '105' item '289' as '35' be re'399'd '43'. The '777'est '6' '344' reli'473' '330' '265' '4' ship '129' upon '4' whale '74' moo'796' '549''500', is by '4' flukes or tail; '6' as '83' '716' '164'er den'421'y '7' '348' is relatively heavier '169' '138' '173' ('722'ing '4' '500'-fins), '716' flexibility '140' in '548', ca'364's it to sink low ben'545'h '4' sur'352'; so '7' '31' '4' h'6' '1' '51''23' '42' at it '83' '4' boat, in '619' to '186' '4' chain round it. But '14' difficulty is ingeniously '118''67': a sm'34', '777' '518' is prepa'796' '31' a wooden float at '716' '44'er '398', '6' a w'879' in '716' '845', '313' '4' '173' '398' is secu'796' to '4' ship.

Ab'44' mid'168' '7' steak '28' '537' '6' cooked; '6' '703'ed by '149' lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb st'44'ly s'111'd up to '90' spermaceti supper at '4' capstan-'342', as if '7' capstan '85' a '500'board.

But, as '332', Stubb heeded '23' '4' mumblings of '4' banquet '7' '28' '45' on so nigh '58', no '117' '169' '4' sharks heeded '4' smacking of '90' '249' epicurean lips.
"Cook, cook!—w'43''s '7' '261' Fleece?" he cried at length, widening '90' legs s'773' fur'4'r, as if to '17'm a '117' secure base '17' '90' supper; '6', at '4' '276' '75' darting '90' '17'k '155' '4' dish, as if stabbing '31' '90' lance; "cook, '1' cook!—sail '14' '103', cook!"

"Cook," '136' Stubb, rapidly lifting a '743' '796'dish morsel to '90' '843', "'21' '1' '54' '14' steak is '743' '118'd'63'? You've '91' '942'ing '14' steak '111' '137', cook; '30' '111' '606'der.

Sullenly '409' '4' '141'e'796' lantern, '261' Fleece limped across '4' deck to '4' bul'869'ks; '6' '98', '31' '63' h'6' '705'ping '90' '703' low '118' '4' sea, so as to '42' a '68' view of '90' congregation, '31' '4' '173' h'6' he solemnly fl'119'i'50'd '90' tongs, '6' leaning '458' '118' '4' '500' in a mumbling '915' began ad'926'ing '4' sharks, '313' Stubb, softly crawling '528', '118''299' '34' '7' '28' '136'.
"Fellow-critters: I'se '619'ed '43' to '99' dat '1' '259' '188' dat dam noise d'36'. You '230'? S'739' dat dam smackin' ob de lips! M'652'a Stubb '99' dat '1' '51' fill y'119' dam bel'596's up to de hatchings, '33' by Gor! '1' '259' '188' dat dam racket!"
"Cook," '43' interposed Stubb, ac'624'ing '4' '429' '31' a sudden slap on '4' '134'er,—"Cook! '65', '386' y'119' '495', '1' '259'n't '746' '7' '103' '74' '41' pr'356'ing. That's no '103' to convert sinners, cook!"
"Who dat? Den pr'356' to '58' y'119''968'," sullenly '391'ing to go.
"No, cook; go on, go on."
"Well, den, Belu'515' '947'ow-critters:"—
"Right!" exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, "coax '514' to it; '244' '7'," '6' Fleece continued.
"Do '1' is '34' sharks, '6' by natur wery woracious, '332' I zay to '1', '947'ow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—''739' dat dam slappin' ob de tail! How '1' tink to '230', spose '1' '184' up '375' a dam slappin' '6' '437'in' d'36'?"
"Cook," cried Stubb, colla'847' '58', "I '205' '19' '7' '746'ing. Talk to '514' gentle'128'ly."
Once '117' '4' sermon proceeded.
"Y'119' woraciousness, '947'ow-critters, I '21' '810' ye so '137' '17'; dat is natur, '6' '51''t be '148'ed; '33' to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is de pint.

"Well d'63', '261' Fleece!" cried Stubb, "'55' '917'tianity; go on."
"No '364' goin' on; de dam '76'ains '76' '184' a scougin' '6' slappin' '356' oder, M'652'a Stubb; dey '21' '230' '63' '429'; no '364' a-pr'356'ing to '375' dam g'uttons as '1' c'34' '514', '773' d'36' bel'596's is '597', '6' d'36' bel'596's is bottom'759'; '6' '74' dey do '42' '514' '597', dey wont '230' '1' den; '17' den dey sink in '4' sea, go '692' to '503' on de coral, '6' '51''t '230' '23'ing at '34', no '117', '17' eber '6' eber."
"Upon my soul, I am '39' of '4' '276' opinion; so '145' '4' benediction, Fleece, '6' '82' '170' to my supper."
Upon '14', Fleece, '956' '312' '524' '118' '4' fishy mob, raised '90' shrill '915', '6' cried—
"Cussed '947'ow-critters! Kick up de '386'dest row as '167' '1' '51'; fill y'119' dam bel'596's ''773' dey bust—'6' den '474'."
"Now, cook," '136' Stubb, resuming '90' supper at '4' capstan; "st'6' '22' w'43' '1' s'111'd '165', t'43', '118' '485' me, '6' '490' '348'icular at'606'tion."
"All 'dention," '136' Fleece, '158' s'111'ping '118' upon '90' tongs in '4' de'284'ed po'421'ion.
"Well," '136' Stubb, '148'ing '58''968' '523'ly '80''313'; "I sh'34' '56' go '78' to '4' subject of '14' steak. In '4' '171' '226', '60' '261' '36' '1', cook?"
"What dat do wid de 'teak," '136' '4' '261' '751', '704'ily.
"Silence! How '261' '36' '1', cook?"
"'B'44' ninety, dey '99'," he gloomily mutte'796'.
"And '1' '19' '349'd in '14' '296' '321' upon '63' hund'796' '266', cook, '6' '21' k'56' '332' '60' to cook a whale-steak?" rapidly bolting an'173' '843'ful at '4' '181' '429', so '7' morsel '562'ed a continuation of '4' '455'. "W'43' '85' '1' born, cook?"
"'Hind de hatch'103', in ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke."
"Born in a ferry-boat! That's queer, '111'. But I '53' to k'56' '11' '893'ry '1' '85' born in, cook!"
"Didn't I '99' de Roanoke '893'ry?" he cried sharply.
"No, '1' '64'n't, cook; '33' '82' '81' '1' '11' '16' '260' to, cook. You '259' go '179' '6' be born '118' '158'; '1' '21' k'56' '60' to cook a whale-steak '332'."
"Bress my soul, if I cook noder '63'," he growled, angrily, '391'ing round to de'348'.
"Come '78' '43', cook;—'43', h'6' me '200' tongs;—'56' '101' '7' '437' of steak t'43', '6' '81' me if '1' '54' '7' steak cooked as it '134' be? Take it, I '99'"—'956' '4' tongs to'869'ds '58'—"'101' it, '6' taste it."
Faintly smacking '90' wit'43'd lips '118' it '17' a mo'508't, '4' '261' negro mutte'796', "Best cooked 'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy."
"Cook," '136' Stubb, squa'847' '58''968' '336' '117'; "do '1' be'192' to '4' church?"
"P'652'ed '63' '336' in Cape-D'249'," '136' '4' '261' '128' sullenly.
"And '1' '19' '336' in y'119' '139' '962'ed a holy church in Cape-T'249', w'43' '1' doubt'759' '118''299' a holy par'273' ad'926'ing '90' he'36'rs as '90' be'112'd '947'ow-cr'545'ures, '19' '1', cook!

"Go to '515' berry '358'," he mumbled, '499'-'391'ing as he spoke.
"Avast! heave to! I '80' '74' '1' '474', cook. It's an awful '455'. Now '11''s y'119' '491'?"
"When dis '261' brack '128' '474's," '136' '4' negro slowly, c'621'ing '90' '251' '769' '6' de'80'or, "he '90''968' '205' go '56''43'; '33' '96' bressed angel '76' '67' '6' fetch '58'."
"Fetch '58'? How? In a coach '6' '492', as '69' fetched Elijah? And fetch '58' w'43'?"
"Up dere," '136' Fleece, '956' '90' tongs '688' '118' '90' '342', '6' '184'ing it t'43' '131' solemnly.
"So, '98', '1' '741' to go up '155' '119' main-'739', do '1', cook, '74' '1' '36' '314'? But '21' '1' k'56' '4' '530'er '1' climb, '4' '690'er it '42's? Main-'739', eh?"
"Didn't '99' dat t''34'," '136' Fleece, '158' in '4' sulks.
"You '136' up t'43', '64'n't '1'? '6' '56' '73' y'119''968', '6' '66' w'43' y'119' tongs '36' '378'ing. But, '760' '1' '741' to '42' '155' heaven by crawling '209' '4' lubber's hole, cook; '33', no, no, cook, '1' '21' '42' t'43', '722' '1' go '4' regular '103', round by '4' rigging.

H'261' it t'43' '56', '6' '490' at'606'tion."
"All 'dention," '136' '4' '261' '751', '31' '312' '524' '226'd as de'284'ed, vainly wriggling '90' grizzled '342', as if to '42' '312' ears in '569' at '63' '6' '4' '276' '75'.
"Well '98', cook, '1' '66' '14' whale-steak of y'119's '28' so '131' '217', '7' I '19' '186' it '44' of sight as '358' as '622'; '1' '66' '7', '21' '1'?

CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.

That mortal '128' '134' feed upon '4' cr'545'ure '7' feeds '90' lamp, '6', '46' Stubb, '545' '58' by '90' '249' '703', as '1' '289' '99'; '14' '562's so '44'l'6'ish a '124' '7' '63' '259' '460' go a '105' '155' '4' '903' '6' philosophy of it.
It is upon record, '7' '291' centuries '414' '4' tongue of '4' Right Whale '28' esteemed a '164' delicacy in F'868'ce, '6' com'128'ded large pr'972's t'43'. Also, '7' in Henry VIIIth's '75', a '979' cook of '4' c'119't obtained a '524'ome re'869'd '17' inventing an admir'473' sauce to be ea'606' '31' '960'bacued porpoises, '265', '1' '219', '36' a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, '36' to '14' '183' con'500''796' '178' '545'ing. The m'545' is '721'e '155' b'34's '39' '4' size of '899'iard b'34's, '6' '213' '35' seas'63'd '6' sp'972'd '240' be '645' '17' turtle-b'34's or veal b'34's.

Among '4' Dutch whale'508' '182' scraps '36' c'34'ed "fritters"; '265', indeed, '69' '164'ly resemble, '213' br'249' '6' crisp, '6' smelling so'559'hing '46' '261' Amsterdam ho'364'wives' dough-nuts or oly-cooks, '74' fresh.

But '11' fur'4'r depreciates '4' whale as a civilized dish, is '90' exceeding richness. He is '4' '164' prize ox of '4' sea, '111' fat to be delicately '68'. Look at '90' hump, '265' '72' be as '178' '545'ing as '4' buffalo's ('265' is esteemed a r'36' dish), '85' it '23' '375' a solid pyramid of fat. But '4' spermaceti '716'elf, '60' bl'6' '6' creamy '7' is; '46' '4' t'868'sp'36'nt, '499'-jel'596'd, '691' m'545' of a cocoanut in '4' third month of '716' growth, '332' '458' '111' rich to supply a substitute '17' '33'ter.

In '4' '192' '244' '430'es of '4' '168' it is a common '124' '17' '4' sea'508' to dip '238' ship-biscuit '155' '4' huge oil-pots '6' '123' '116' fry t'43' a'313'. M'138' a '68' supper '19' I thus '721'e.
In '4' '390' of a sm'34' Sperm Whale '4' brains '36' ac'893'ed a '178' dish. The c'257'et of '4' skull is '785'n '155' '31' an axe, '6' '4' '149' plump, w'479'ish lobes '213' '31'drawn (precisely resembling '149' large puddings), '69' '36' '98' mixed '31' fl'119', '6' cooked '155' a '344' delect'473' '921', in flavor '96''11' resembling calves' '342', '265' is '538' a dish among '96' epicures; '6' e'131' '63' '359' '7' '96' '507' bucks among '4' epicures, by continu'34'y dining upon calves' brains, by '6' by '42' to '19' a '105' brains of '238' '249', so as to be '473' to '81' a calf's '342' '83' '238' '249' '342's; '265', indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.

The '342' '388' a '563' of reproach'597'y at '58', '31' an "Et tu Brute!" expression.
It is '23', '760', '797'ly beca'364' '4' whale is so excessively unctuous '7' l'6's'508' '562' to regard '4' '545'ing of '58' '31' abhorrence; '7' appears to result, in '96' '103', '83' '4' con'500'ration '165' '508'ti'63'd: i.e. '7' a '128' '134' '545' a '212'ly murde'796' '124' of '4' sea, '6' '545' it '111' by '716' '249' '703'.

When in '4' Sou'4'rn Fi'50'ry, a captu'796' Sperm Whale, '180' '192' '6' '854'y toil, is '561' '549''500' '399' at '168', it is '23', as a general '124' at '402', customary to proceed at '336' to '4' '355' of '537'ting '58' in. For '7' '355' is an exceedingly laborious '63'; is '23' '131' '358' comp'123'ed; '6' requires '34' '524' to '451' '39' it.

It '28' a Satur'183' '168', '6' '375' a Sabbath as '858'ed! Ex '141'icio professors of Sabbath '448'ing '36' '34' whale'508'. The ivory Pequod '28' '391'ed '155' '11' '562'ed a shamble; e'131' sailor a '33'c'49'. You '72' '19' '147' we '85' '141'e'847' up '606' thous'6' '796' oxen to '4' sea '152's.
In '4' '171' '226', '4' enormous '537'ting tackles, among '173' ponderous '124's comprising a cluster of blocks gener'34'y '684'ted green, '6' '265' no single '128' '51' '999' lift—'14' vast bunch of grapes '28' s'103'ed up to '4' main-'739' '6' firmly la'50'd to '4' l'969'r mast-'342', '4' '777'est '378' '138'w'43' above a ship's deck. The '398' of '4' hawser-'46' rope '768'ding '209' '182' intricacies, '28' '98' conducted to '4' '768'dl'652', '6' '4' huge l'969'r block of '4' tackles '28' swung '118' '4' whale; to '14' block '4' '164' blubber hook, weighing '96' '63' hund'796' pounds, '28' attached. And '56' susp'398'ed in stages '118' '4' '500', Starbuck '6' Stubb, '4' mates, armed '31' '238' '192' spades, began '537'ting a hole in '4' '618' '17' '4' insertion of '4' hook '22' above '4' '958'est of '4' '149' '500'-fins. T'90' d'63', a b'937', semicircular '518' is '537' round '4' hole, '4' hook is inserted, '6' '4' main '618' of '4' crew striking up a wild chorus, '56' com'508'ce heaving in '63' dense crowd at '4' '768'dl'652'. When instantly, '4' '797' ship '324'eens '118' on '49' '500'; e'131' bolt in '49' '319's '46' '4' nail-'342's of an '261' ho'364' in frosty wea'4'r; '50' trembles, quivers, '6' nods '49' f'40'ed mast-'342's to '4' sky.

Now as '4' blubber envelopes '4' whale precisely as '4' rind '185' an o'868'ge, so is it s'798'ped '141' '83' '4' '618' precisely as an o'868'ge is so'559'imes s'798'ped by spiralizing it. For '4' strain constantly '764' up by '4' '768'dl'652' continu'34'y '184's '4' whale rolling '118' '6' '118' in '4' '604', '6' as '4' blubber in '63' s'798' uni'17'mly peels '141' '549' '4' '518' c'34'ed '4' "s'324'f," simultaneously '537' by '4' spades of Starbuck '6' Stubb, '4' mates; '6' '22' as '692' as it is thus peeled '141', '6' indeed by '7' '131' '735' '716'elf, it is '34' '4' '75' '213' hoisted '530'er '6' '530'er aloft '773' '716' upper '398' grazes '4' main-'739'; '4' '508' at '4' '768'dl'652' '98' cease heaving, '6' '17' a mo'508't or '149' '4' prodigious '593'-dripping m'652' s'103's to '6' fro as if '123' d'249' '83' '4' sky, '6' e'131' '63' '986' '259' '101' '68' heed to dodge it '74' it s'768'gs, '234' it '289' '990' '90' ears '6' pitch '58' '342''192' '118'board.

And thus '4' '176' proceeds; '4' '149' tackles hoisting '6' l'969''847' simultaneously; '312' whale '6' '768'dl'652' heaving, '4' heavers singing, '4' blubber-'267' gentle'508' coiling, '4' mates s'324'fing, '4' ship straining, '6' '34' '524' '746'ing occasion'34'y, by '103' of '652'uaging '4' general friction.




CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.

I '19' '145'n no sm'34' at'606'tion to '7' '23' unvexed subject, '4' skin of '4' whale. I '19' '97' contr'118'sies '39' it '31' experienced whale'508' afloat, '6' '819'ed natura'919's ashore. My original opinion remains un'397'd; '33' it is '146' an opinion.
The '455' is, '11' '6' w'43' is '4' skin of '4' whale? Al'325' '1' k'56' '11' '90' blubber is. That blubber is so'559'hing of '4' consis'606'ce of firm, '452'-grained beef, '33' '889'er, '117' e'181'ic '6' comp'735', '6' '868'ges '83' '879' or '606' to twelve '6' fifteen inches in thickness.
Now, '60''167' preposterous it '289' at '171' '562' to '150' of '138' cr'545'ure's skin as '213' of '7' '563' of consis'606'ce '6' thickness, '332' in '378' of '418' '182' '36' no argu'508'ts '485' '375' a presumption; beca'364' '1' '51''23' raise '138' '173' dense enveloping layer '83' '4' whale's '618' '33' '7' '276' blubber; '6' '4' '44'er'344' enveloping layer of '138' animal, if '385'ably dense, '11' '51' '7' be '33' '4' skin? True, '83' '4' unmar'796' '314' '618' of '4' whale, '1' '289' scrape '141' '31' y'119' h'6' an infinitely thin, t'868'sp'36'nt substance, '96''11' resembling '4' thinnest sh'796's of isingl'652', '146' it is al'344' as flexible '6' soft as satin; '7' is, previous to '213' dried, '74' it '23' '146' contr'735's '6' thickens, '33' be'67's '743' '321' '6' brittle. I '19' s'167'al '375' dried b'716', '265' I '364' '17' marks in my whale-'560's. It is t'868'sp'36'nt, as I '136' '165'; '6' '213' laid upon '4' printed page, I '19' so'559'imes '142'd '302' '31' fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At '138' rate, it is pleasant to '504' '39' whales '209' '238' '249' spectacles, as '1' '289' '99'. But '11' I am driving at '43' is '14'. That '276' infinitely thin, isingl'652' substance, '265', I '774', invests '4' '797' '618' of '4' whale, is '23' so '137' to be regarded as '4' skin of '4' cr'545'ure, as '4' skin of '4' skin, so to '613'; '17' it '85' simply ridiculous to '99', '7' '4' proper skin of '4' tre'508'dous whale is thinner '6' '117' '606'der '169' '4' skin of a '212'-born '497'. But no '117' of '14'.
Assuming '4' blubber to be '4' skin of '4' whale; '98', '74' '14' skin, as in '4' '390' of a '131' large Sperm Whale, '76' yield '4' bulk of '63' hund'796' '960'rels of oil; '6', '74' it is con'500''796' '7', in quantity, or '743' w'879', '7' oil, in '716' expressed '892', is '146' '291' '492'ths, '6' '23' '4' '797' substance of '4' coat; '96' '256' '289' hence be '97' of '4' enormousness of '7' animated m'652', a mere '348' of '94'se mere integu'508't yields '375' a lake of liquid as '7'. Reckoning '606' '960'rels to '4' ton, '1' '19' '606' tons '17' '4' net w'879' of '146' '291' quarters of '4' '343' of '4' whale's skin.
In '139', '4' visible sur'352' of '4' Sperm Whale is '23' '4' '402' among '4' '128'y marvels he '986's. Al'344' invariably it is '34' '118' obliquely crossed '6' re-crossed '31' '539''759' '688' marks in thick array, so'559'hing '46' '200' in '4' '178'st Italian '518' engravings. But '182' marks do '23' '562' to be impressed upon '4' isingl'652' substance above '508'ti'63'd, '33' '562' to be '333' '209' it, as if '69' '85' engraved upon '4' '618' '716'elf. Nor is '14' '34'. In '96' instances, to '4' quick, observant '784', '200' li'958' marks, as in a verit'473' engraving, '33' af'17'd '4' ground '17' '458' '173' de'518'ations. These '36' hieroglyphical; '7' is, if '1' c'34' '200' mysterious cyp'49's on '4' w'34's of pyramids hieroglyphics, '98' '7' is '4' proper '429' to '364' in '4' '986' connexion. By my re'606'tive memory of '4' hieroglyphics upon '63' Sperm Whale in '348'icular, I '28' '137' struck '31' a p'399' re'986'ing '4' '261' Indian char'735'ers c'90'elled on '4' famous hieroglyphic palisades on '4' banks of '4' Upper Mississippi. Like '200' mystic rocks, '111', '4' mystic-marked whale remains undecip'49''473'. T'90' '34'usion to '4' Indian rocks re'241's me of an'173' '124'. Be'500's '34' '4' '173' pheno'508'a '265' '4' exterior of '4' Sperm Whale '986's, he '23' seldom dis'412's '4' '78', '6' '117' especi'34'y '90' flanks, ef'352'd in '164' '348' of '4' regular li'958' appea'868'ce, by '385' of numerous rude scratches, alto'42''49' of an irregular, r'6'om aspect. I '134' '99' '7' '200' New Engl'6' rocks on '4' sea-coast, '265' Ag'652'iz '805's to bear '4' marks of violent scraping cont'735' '31' vast floating '972'bergs—I '134' '99', '7' '200' rocks '259' '23' a '105' resemble '4' Sperm Whale in '14' '348'icular. It '516' '562's to me '7' '375' scratches in '4' whale '36' '307' '721'e by hostile cont'735' '31' '173' whales; '17' I '19' '344' remarked '116' in '4' large, '597'-gr'249' bulls of '4' species.
A '429' or '149' '117' c'336'rning '14' '301' of '4' skin or blubber of '4' whale. It '129' '287' '91' '136', '7' it is s'798't '83' '58' in '192' '747's, c'34'ed blanket-'747's. Like '344' sea-terms, '14' '63' is '131' '280' '6' '659'ifi'51't. For '4' whale is indeed wrapt up in '90' blubber as in a '272' blanket or '893'erpane; or, s'773' '166', an Indian poncho slipt '118' '90' '342', '6' skirting '90' extremity. It is by '385' of '14' cosy blanketing of '90' '618', '7' '4' whale is en'473'd to '184' '58''968' com'17't'473' in '34' wea'4'rs, in '34' seas, '464', '6' tides. What '72' be'67' of a Greenl'6' whale, '99', in '200' shudde'847', icy seas of '4' North, if unsupp'596'd '31' '90' cosy surt'44'? True, '173' fish '36' '295' exceedingly brisk in '200' Hyperborean '604's; '33' '182', be it observed, '36' y'119' '690'-'593'ed, lung'759' fish, '94'se '131' bel'596's '36' refrigerators; cr'545'ures, '7' '869'm '116'selves '447' '4' lee of an '972'berg, as a traveller in '768'ter '72' b'257' '165' an inn '522'; w'43'as, '46' '128', '4' whale '129' lungs '6' '869'm '593'. Freeze '90' '593', '6' he '474's. How '533' is it '98'—'722' '180' ex'519'ation—'7' '14' '164' monster, to '94'm corpo'272' '869'mth is as indispens'473' as it is to '128'; '60' '533' '7' he '134' be '295' at '179', immersed to '90' lips '17' '139' in '200' Arctic '604's! w'43', '74' sea'508' f'34' '118'board, '69' '36' so'559'imes '295', '611' '180''869'ds, perp'398'icularly frozen '155' '4' '374's of fields of '972', as a fly is '295' glued in amber. But '117' surprising is it to k'56', as '129' '91' '831'd by experi'508't, '7' '4' '593' of a Polar whale is '869'mer '169' '7' of a Borneo negro in summer.
It '185' '562' to me, '7' '43'in we '66' '4' r'36' virtue of a '777' individual vitality, '6' '4' r'36' virtue of thick w'34's, '6' '4' r'36' virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, '128'! admire '6' model thy'968' '180' '4' whale! Do thou, '111', remain '869'm among '972'. Do thou, '111', '349' in '14' '296' '327' '213' of it. Be '494' at '4' equator; '184' thy '593' fluid at '4' Pole. Like '4' '164' dome of St. Peter's, '6' '46' '4' '164' whale, retain, O '128'! in '34' sea'273's a temperature of thine '249'.
But '60' '454' '6' '60' '274''759' to t'356' '182' '178' '124's! Of erections, '60' '360' '36' domed '46' St. Peter's! of cr'545'ures, '60' '360' vast as '4' whale!




CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.

Haul in '4' chains! Let '4' '324''390' go astern!
The vast tackles '19' '56' d'63' '238' duty. The peeled '691' '618' of '4' be'342'ed whale fla'50's '46' a marble sepulchre; '463' '397'd in hue, it '129' '23' perceptibly '387' '138''124' in bulk. It is s'773' colossal. Slowly it floats '117' '6' '117' '170', '4' '604' round it torn '6' spla'50'd by '4' insatiate sharks, '6' '4' '769' above vexed '31' rapacious f'703's of screaming fowls, '94'se beaks '36' '46' so '128'y insulting poniards in '4' whale. The vast '691' '342''759' phantom floats fur'4'r '6' fur'4'r '83' '4' ship, '6' e'131' rod '7' it so floats, '11' '562' squ'36' roods of sharks '6' cubic roods of fowls, aug'508't '4' '776'ous din. For '520' '6' '520' '83' '4' al'344' stationary ship '7' hideous sight is '333'. '742''545'h '4' unclouded '6' mild azure sky, upon '4' '807' '352' of '4' pleasant sea, wafted by '4' jo'1's breezes, '7' '164' m'652' of '548' floats on '6' on, '773' '387' in infinite perspectives.
T'43''s a '344' doleful '6' '344' mocking '427'eral! The sea-vultures '34' in pious m'119'ning, '4' '769'-sharks '34' punctiliously in '751' or speckled. In '139' '33' '360' of '116' '72' '19' '148'ed '4' whale, I ween, if peradventure he '97' '643' it; '33' upon '4' banquet of '90' '427'eral '69' '344' piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of '987'! '83' '265' '23' '4' '240'iest whale is '523'.
Nor is '14' '4' '398'. Desecrated as '4' '618' is, a vengeful ghost survives '6' h'118's '118' it to s'324'e. Espied by '96' timid '128'-of-'869' or bl'447'ing disco'131'-vessel '83' a'458', '74' '4' distance obscu'847' '4' s'869'ming fowls, n'167''4''759' s'773' s'60's '4' '691' m'652' floating in '4' sun, '6' '4' '691' spray heaving '530' '485' it; '688''103' '4' whale's unharming corpse, '31' trembling fingers is '451' d'249' in '4' log—shoals, rocks, '6' '448'ers '43''39's: bew'36'! And '17' '266' '180''869'ds, '760', ships shun '4' '226'; leaping '118' it as silly '50'ep leap '118' a vacuum, beca'364' '238' leader origin'34'y leaped t'43' '74' a '856' '28' held. T'43''s y'119' '749' of precedents; t'43''s y'119' utility of traditions; t'43''s '4' '480' of y'119' obstinate survival of '261' be'596'fs n'167' bottomed on '4' '987', '6' '56' '23' '140' h'118'ing in '4' '769'! T'43''s orthodoxy!
Thus, '313' in '139' '4' '164' whale's '618' '289' '19' '91' a '272' terror to '90' foes, in '90' '548' '90' ghost be'67's a '637''759' panic to a '296'.
Are '1' a beli'167' in ghosts, my fri'398'? T'43' '36' '173' ghosts '169' '4' Cock-Lane '63', '6' '458' deeper '508' '169' Doctor '608''273' '94' '172' in '116'.




CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.

It '134' '23' '19' '91' omitted '7' previous to comp'123'ely s'798'ping '4' '618' of '4' levia'169', he '28' be'342'ed. Now, '4' be'342'ing of '4' Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical f'545', upon '265' experienced whale surgeons '131' '137' p'852' '116'selves: '6' '23' '327' '385'.
Con'500'r '7' '4' whale '129' no'124' '7' '51' properly be c'34'ed a neck; on '4' contrary, w'43' '90' '342' '6' '618' '562' to join, t'43', in '7' '131' '226', is '4' thickest '348' of '58'. Remember, '516', '7' '4' surgeon '259' operate '83' above, '96' '879' or '606' '908' intervening '592'ween '58' '6' '90' subject, '6' '7' subject al'344' hidden in a discol'119'ed, rolling, '6' of'606''464' tumultuous '6' bursting sea. Bear in '241', '111', '7' '447' '182' unto'869'd circumstances he '129' to '537' '128'y '908' deep in '4' flesh; '6' in '7' subter'868'eous '128'ner, '327' so '137' as '42'ting '63' single peep '155' '4' '167'-contr'735'ing gash thus '721'e, he '259' skil'597'y steer '574' of '34' adjacent, interdicted '348's, '6' '304' divide '4' spine at a critical '378' '321' by '716' insertion '155' '4' skull. Do '1' '23' marvel, '98', at Stubb's boast, '7' he de'128'ded '33' '606' '294's to be'342' a sperm whale?
When '171' s'167'ed, '4' '342' is '705'ped astern '6' held t'43' by a c'473' '773' '4' '618' is s'798'ped. That d'63', if it be'192' to a sm'34' whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, '31' a '597' gr'249' levia'169' '14' is im'622'; '17' '4' sperm whale's '342' embraces '958'ly '63' third of '90' '797' bulk, '6' comp'123'ely to susp'398' '375' a burden as '7', '140' by '4' im'508'se tackles of a whaler, '14' '85' as vain a '124' as to attempt weighing a Dutch '960'n in je'35'ers' scales.
The Pequod's whale '213' decapitated '6' '4' '618' s'798'ped, '4' '342' '28' hoisted '485' '4' ship's '500'—'39' '499' '103' '44' of '4' sea, so '7' it '240' '332' in '164' '348' be buoyed up by '716' native ele'508't. And t'43' '31' '4' strained craft steeply leaning '118' to it, by '385' of '4' enormous d'249''869'd drag '83' '4' l'969'r mast-'342', '6' e'131' yard-arm on '7' '500' projecting '46' a c'868'e '118' '4' waves; t'43', '7' '593'-dripping '342' hung to '4' Pequod's waist '46' '4' giant Holofernes's '83' '4' girdle of Judith.
When '14' '181' t'257' '28' accompli'50'd it '28' noon, '6' '4' sea'508' '277' below to '238' '484'. Silence reigned '118' '4' '165' tumultuous '33' '56' deserted deck.

A '940' space elapsed, '6' up '155' '14' noise'759'ness '246' Ahab al'63' '83' '90' cabin. Taking a '360' '391's on '4' quarter-deck, he pa'364'd to gaze '118' '4' '500', '98' slowly '42'ting '155' '4' main-chains he '111'k Stubb's '192' spade—s'773' remaining t'43' '180' '4' whale's Decapitation—'6' striking it '155' '4' l'969'r '348' of '4' '499'-susp'398'ed m'652', '226'd '716' '173' '398' crutch-wise '447' '63' arm, '6' so s'111'd leaning '118' '31' '495' at'606'tively '950'ed on '14' '342'.

"Sail ho!" cried a triumphant '915' '83' '4' main-mast-'342'.
"Aye? Well, '56', '55' chee'847'," cried Ahab, suddenly erecting '58''968', '313' '251' th'447'-clouds swept a'500' '83' '90' brow. "That '349'ly cry upon '14' '314'ly '804' '240' al'344' convert a '166' '128'.—W'43' '170'?"

CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam's Story.

H'6' in h'6', ship '6' breeze blew on; '33' '4' breeze '246' '692'er '169' '4' ship, '6' '358' '4' Pequod began to rock.
By '6' by, '209' '4' gl'652' '4' st'868'ger's boats '6' '128'ned mast-'342's '831'd '49' a whale-ship. But as '50' '28' so '458' to '768'd'869'd, '6' '855'ing by, app'36'ntly '380' a '962'age to '96' '173' ground, '4' Pequod '87' '23' '274' to r'356' '49'. So '4' '659'al '28' '451' to '66' '11' response '72' be '721'e.
Here be it '136', '7' '46' '4' vessels of military marines, '4' ships of '4' Ameri'51' Whale Fleet '19' '356' a '988' '659'al; '34' '265' '659'als '213' collected in a '560' '31' '4' '275's of '4' '952'ive vessels attached, e'131' captain is provided '31' it. T'43'by, '4' whale com'128'ders '36' en'473'd to recognise '356' '173' upon '4' ocean, '140' at con'500'r'473' distances '6' '31' no sm'34' facility.
The Pequod's '659'al '28' at '181' responded to by '4' st'868'ger's '451'ting '49' '249'; '265' '831'd '4' ship to be '4' Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squa'847' '49' yards, '50' bore d'249', '868'ged abeam '447' '4' Pequod's lee, '6' l'969''796' a boat; it '358' drew nigh; '33', as '4' '500'-ladder '28' '213' rigged by Starbuck's '619' to accommo'517' '4' vi'421'ing captain, '4' st'868'ger in '455' waved '90' h'6' '83' '90' boat's stern in token of '7' proceeding '213' '797'ly unnecessary. It '391'ed '44' '7' '4' Jeroboam '97' a malignant epidemic on board, '6' '7' Mayhew, '49' captain, '28' fearful of infecting '4' Pequod's '624'. For, '463' '58''968' '6' boat's crew remained untainted, '6' '463' '90' ship '28' '499' a rifle-s'576' '141', '6' an incorruptible sea '6' '769' rolling '6' flo'768'g '592'ween; '332' conscientiously adhe'847' to '4' timid qua'868'tine of '4' l'6', he peremptorily ref'364'd to '67' '155' direct cont'735' '31' '4' Pequod.
But '14' '64' by no '410' pr'140't '34' communications. Preserving an interval of '96' '360' yards '592'ween '716'elf '6' '4' ship, '4' Jeroboam's boat by '4' occasional '364' of '716' oars contrived to '184' par'34'el to '4' Pequod, as '50' heavily '17'ged '209' '4' sea ('17' by '14' '75' it blew '131' fresh), '31' '49' main-'739'sail a'78'; '463', indeed, at '464' by '4' sudden on'451' of a large rolling wave, '4' boat '72' be pu'50'd '96' '103' '531'; '33' '72' be '358' skil'597'y '561' to '49' proper bea'847's '158'. Subject to '14', '6' '173' '4' '46' interruptions '56' '6' '98', a conversation '28' sustained '592'ween '4' '149' '348'ies; '33' at intervals '23' '327' s'773' an'173' interruption of a '131' '465' '563'.
Pulling an oar in '4' Jeroboam's boat, '28' a '128' of a singular appea'868'ce, '140' in '7' wild whaling '139' w'43' individual '23'abilities '106' up '34' totalities. He '28' a sm'34', '940', '507'ish '128', sprinkled '34' '118' '90' '352' '31' freckles, '6' wea'847' '796'undant yellow h'769'. A '192'-skirted, caba'919'ic'34'y-'537' coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped '58'; '4' '118'lapping sleeves of '265' '85' rolled up on '90' wrists. A deep, '451'tled, fanatic delirium '28' in '90' '495'.
So '358' as '14' '575' '97' '91' '171' descried, Stubb '97' exclaimed—"That's he! '55' he!—'4' '192'-togged s'324'amouch '4' T'249'-Ho's '624' '163' us of!" Stubb '43' '34'uded to a st'868'ge '480' '163' of '4' Jeroboam, '6' a '979' '128' among '49' crew, '96' '75' previous '74' '4' Pequod spoke '4' T'249'-Ho. According to '14' ac'893' '6' '11' '28' subsequently '819'ed, it '562'ed '7' '4' s'324'amouch in '455' '97' gained a '533' asc'398'ency '118' al'344' e'131''618' in '4' Jeroboam. His '480' '28' '14':
He '97' '91' origin'34'y nurtu'796' among '4' '419' society of Neskyeuna Shakers, w'43' he '97' '91' a '164' prophet; in '238' cracked, '669' '381'ings '305' s'167'al '464' desc'398'ed '83' heaven by '4' '103' of a trap-'450', announcing '4' speedy '422'ing of '4' s'140'th vial, '265' he '324'ried in '90' vest-pocket; '33', '265', '861' of containing '723'powder, '28' '340' to be charged '31' laudanum. A st'868'ge, apostolic w'58' '305' seized '58', he '97' '269' Neskyeuna '17' Nantucket, w'43', '31' '7' cunning peculiar to craziness, he '652'umed a steady, common-'587' exterior, '6' '141'e'796' '58''968' as a green-h'6' '51''64'ate '17' '4' Jeroboam's whaling voyage. T'84' engaged '58'; '33' '688''103' upon '4' ship's '42'ting '44' of sight of l'6', '90' insanity '785' '44' in a fre'50't. He announced '58''968' as '4' ar'397'l Gabriel, '6' com'128'ded '4' captain to jump '118'board. He publi'50'd '90' '128'ifesto, w'43'by he '451' '58''968' '17'th as '4' de'349'rer of '4' isles of '4' sea '6' vi'324'-general of '34' Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness '31' '265' he decla'796' '182' '124's;—'4' '967', da'847' '412' of '90' '503''759', excited imagination, '6' '34' '4' preternatural terrors of '272' delirium, united to invest '14' Gabriel in '4' '241's of '4' majority of '4' igno'868't crew, '31' an atmosp'43' of sac'796'ness. More'118', '69' '85' '423' of '58'. As '375' a '128', '60''167', '28' '23' of '137' pr'735'ical '364' in '4' ship, especi'34'y as he ref'364'd to '176' '722' '74' he '142'd, '4' inc'796'ulous captain '72' fain '19' '91' rid of '58'; '33' apprised '7' '7' individual's in'606'tion '28' to l'6' '58' in '4' '171' convenient port, '4' ar'397'l '17'th'31' '422'ed '34' '90' seals '6' vials—devoting '4' ship '6' '34' '524' to unconditional perdition, in '390' '14' in'606'tion '28' '324'ried '44'. So '777'ly '64' he '176' upon '90' disciples among '4' crew, '7' at '181' in a '618' '69' '277' to '4' captain '6' '163' '58' if Gabriel '28' '708' '83' '4' ship, '23' a '128' of '116' '72' remain. He '28' t'43''17'e '17'ced to relinquish '90' '519'. Nor '72' '69' permit Gabriel to be '138' '103' maltr'545'ed, '99' or do '11' he '72'; so '7' it '246' to '962' '7' Gabriel '97' '4' comp'123'e '523'dom of '4' ship. The consequence of '34' '14' '28', '7' '4' ar'397'l '324'ed '105' or no'124' '17' '4' captain '6' mates; '6' '317' '4' epidemic '97' '785'n '44', he '324'ried a '530'er h'6' '169' '167'; decla'847' '7' '4' plague, as he c'34'ed it, '28' at '90' sole com'128'd; nor '134' it be '235'ed '33' according to '90' '68' plea'115'. The sailors, '344'ly '719' d'779's, c'847'ed, '6' '96' of '116' fawned '165' '58'; in obe'474'nce to '90' instructions, so'559'imes r'398'e'847' '58' '771' homage, as to a '152'. Such '124's '289' '562' inc'796'ible; '33', '60''167' wondrous, '69' '36' '354'. Nor is '4' '903' of fanatics '499' so striking in '952' to '4' mea'115''759' '968'-deception of '4' fanatic '58''968', as '90' mea'115''759' '637' of deceiving '6' '515''779'ling so '128'y '173's. But it is '75' to re'391' to '4' Pequod.
"I fear '23' thy epidemic, '128'," '136' Ahab '83' '4' bul'869'ks, to Captain Mayhew, '94' s'111'd in '4' boat's stern; "'67' on board."
But '56' Gabriel '319'ed to '90' '908'.
"Think, '54' of '4' f'167's, yellow '6' bilious! Bew'36' of '4' horrible plague!"
"Gabriel! Gabriel!" cried Captain Mayhew; "thou '259' ei'4'r—" But '7' instant a '342''192' wave s'576' '4' boat '458' '531', '6' '716' '66''124's dr'249'ed '34' speech.
"Hast thou '333' '4' W'479'e Whale?" de'128'ded Ahab, '74' '4' boat drifted '78'.
"Think, '54' of thy whale-boat, stoven '6' sunk! Bew'36' of '4' horrible tail!"
"I '81' '4'e '158', Gabriel, '7'—" But '158' '4' boat tore '531' as if dragged by fi'398's. No'124' '28' '136' '17' '96' mo'508'ts, '313' a succession of riotous waves rolled by, '265' by '63' of '200' occasional capr'972's of '4' seas '85' tumbling, '23' heaving it. Mean'75', '4' hoisted sperm whale's '342' jogged '39' '131' violently, '6' Gabriel '28' '333' '784'ing it '31' '743' '117' apprehensiveness '169' '90' ar'397'l nature '562'ed to '869''868't.
When '14' interlude '28' '118', Captain Mayhew began a '967' '480' c'336'rning Moby Dick; '23', '60''167', '327' frequent interruptions '83' Gabriel, '74''167' '90' '275' '28' '508'ti'63'd, '6' '4' '419' sea '7' '562'ed leagued '31' '58'.
It '562'ed '7' '4' Jeroboam '97' '23' '192' '269' '179', '74' upon '613'ing a whale-ship, '49' '151' '85' reliably apprised of '4' exis'606'ce of Moby Dick, '6' '4' havoc he '97' '721'e. Greedily sucking in '14' in'81'igence, Gabriel solemnly '869'ned '4' captain '485' attacking '4' W'479'e Whale, in '390' '4' monster '134' be '333'; in '90' gibbe'847' insanity, pronouncing '4' W'479'e Whale to be no '759' a '213' '169' '4' Shaker God in'324'nated; '4' Shakers receiving '4' Bible. But '74', '96' '407' or '149' '180''869'ds, Moby Dick '28' '807'ly sighted '83' '4' mast-'342's, Macey, '4' chief mate, burned '31' ard'119' to en'893'er '58'; '6' '4' captain '58''968' '213' '23' un'76'ing to '123' '58' '19' '4' opportunity, despite '34' '4' ar'397'l's denunciations '6' '17'e'869'nings, Macey succeeded in persuading '401' '508' to '128' '90' boat. With '116' he pu'50'd '141'; '6', '180' '137' '854'y '732'ing, '6' '128'y perilous, unsuccessful on'451's, he at '181' succeeded in '42'ting '63' iron '692'. Mean'75', Gabriel, asc'398'ing to '4' main-royal mast-'342', '28' tossing '63' arm in f'868'tic gestures, '6' hurling '17'th prophecies of speedy doom to '4' sacrilegious '652'ailants of '90' divinity. Now, '313' Macey, '4' mate, '28' st'6'ing up in '90' boat's bow, '6' '31' '34' '4' reck'759' energy of '90' tribe '28' venting '90' wild exclamations upon '4' whale, '6' es'99'ing to '42' a '807' '365' '17' '90' poised lance, lo! a b'937' '691' s'97'ow rose '83' '4' sea; by '716' quick, fanning motion, temporarily '409' '4' br'545'h '44' of '4' bo'474's of '4' oars'508'. Next instant, '4' '672''759' mate, so '597' of furious '139', '28' smit'606' bodily '155' '4' '769', '6' '380' a '192' arc in '90' descent, '947' '155' '4' sea at '4' distance of '39' fifty yards. Not a chip of '4' boat '28' harmed, nor a h'769' of '138' oars'128''s '342'; '33' '4' mate '17' '167' sank.
It is '35' to p'36'n'4'size '43', '7' of '4' fatal '829's in '4' Sperm-Whale Fi'50'ry, '14' '207' is '760' al'344' as frequent as '138'. So'559'imes, no'124' is inju'796' '33' '4' '128' '94' is thus annihi'399'd; of'606'er '4' boat's bow is knocked '141', or '4' t'530'-board, in '265' '4' '342's'128' st'6's, is torn '83' '716' '226' '6' accompanies '4' '618'. But st'868'gest of '34' is '4' circumstance, '7' in '117' instances '169' '63', '74' '4' '618' '129' '91' rec'118'ed, '23' a single mark of violence is discernible; '4' '128' '213' stark '314'.
The '251' calamity, '31' '4' f'34'ing '17'm of Macey, '28' plainly descried '83' '4' ship. Raising a piercing shriek—"The vial! '4' vial!" Gabriel c'34'ed '141' '4' terror-stricken crew '83' '4' fur'4'r hunting of '4' whale. T'90' '816' '140't c'202'hed '4' ar'397'l '31' added influence; beca'364' '90' c'796'ulous disciples '172'd '7' he '97' specific'34'y '17'e-announced it, '861' of '146' '380' a general prophecy, '265' '138' '63' '240' '19' d'63', '6' so '19' '365'd to '479' '63' of '128'y marks in '4' wide margin '34''969'd. He be'246' a '275''759' terror to '4' ship.
Mayhew '305' concluded '90' narration, Ahab '186' '375' '681' to '58', '7' '4' st'868'ger captain '87' '23' '17'bear inqui'847' whe'4'r he in'606'ded to hunt '4' W'479'e Whale, if opportunity '134' '141'er. To '265' Ahab '491'ed—"Aye." Straight'103', '98', Gabriel '336' '117' '319'ed to '90' '908', gla'847' upon '4' '261' '128', '6' vehe'508'tly exclaimed, '31' d'249''869'd '378'ed finger—"Think, '54' of '4' blasphemer—'314', '6' d'249' t'43'!—bew'36' of '4' blasphemer's '398'!"
Ahab stolidly '391'ed a'500'; '98' '136' to Mayhew, "Captain, I '19' '22' '592'hought me of my '123'ter-bag; t'43' is a '123'ter '17' '63' of thy '493'rs, if I mis'101' '23'. Starbuck, '73' '118' '4' bag."
E'131' whale-ship '726' '44' a '68'ly '539' of '123'ters '17' various ships, '94'se deli'131' to '4' '369's to '94'm '69' '289' be ad'926'ed, dep'398's upon '4' mere '365' of en'893'e'847' '116' in '4' '492' oceans. Thus, '344' '123'ters n'167' r'356' '238' mark; '6' '128'y '36' '146' received '180' attaining an age of '149' or '291' '266' or '117'.
Soon Starbuck re'391'ed '31' a '123'ter in '90' h'6'. It '28' sorely tumbled, damp, '6' c'118'ed '31' a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of '213' '764' in a '967' locker of '4' cabin. Of '375' a '123'ter, D'545'h '58''968' '240' '35' '19' '91' '4' post-'311'.
"Can'st '23' '504' it?" cried Ahab. "Give it me, '128'. Aye, aye, '30' '33' a dim scrawl;—'11''s '14'?" As he '28' studying it '44', Starbuck '111'k a '192' '537'ting-spade pole, '6' '31' '90' knife s'703'ly split '4' '398', to insert '4' '123'ter t'43', '6' in '7' '103', h'6' it to '4' boat, '327' '716' '260' '138' '452'r to '4' ship.
Mean'75', Ahab '956' '4' '123'ter, mutte'796', "'197' Har—'89', '197' Harry—(a '263''s pinny h'6',—'4' '128''s '362', '82' wager)—Aye—'197' Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;—'65' '30' Macey, '6' '86' '314'!"
"Poor '947'ow! '719' '947'ow! '6' '83' '90' '362'," sighed Mayhew; "'33' '123' me '19' it."
"Nay, '184' it thy'968'," cried Gabriel to Ahab; "thou art '358' '45' '7' '103'."
"Curses throttle '4'e!" yelled Ahab. "Captain Mayhew, st'6' by '56' to receive it"; '6' '409' '4' fatal '376'ive '83' Starbuck's '524', he '808' it in '4' slit of '4' pole, '6' r'356'ed it '118' to'869'ds '4' boat. But as he '64' so, '4' oars'508' '741'antly desisted '83' ro'768'g; '4' boat drifted a '105' to'869'ds '4' ship's stern; so '7', as if by magic, '4' '123'ter suddenly '868'ged '549' '31' Gabriel's eager h'6'. He clutched it in an instant, seized '4' boat-knife, '6' impaling '4' '123'ter on it, '708' it thus loaded '78' '155' '4' ship. It '947' at Ahab's '908'. Then Gabriel shrieked '44' to '90' comrades to '145' '103' '31' '238' oars, '6' in '7' '128'ner '4' mutinous boat rapidly s'576' '170' '83' '4' Pequod.

CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.

In '4' tumultuous '355' of '537'ting-in '6' at'606'ding to a whale, t'43' is '137' '573' '78''869'ds '6' '17''869'ds among '4' crew. Now '524' '36' '53'ed '43', '6' '98' '158' '524' '36' '53'ed t'43'. T'43' is no '939' in '138' '63' '226'; '17' at '63' '6' '4' '276' '75' e'131''124' '129' to be d'63' e'131'w'43'. It is '137' '4' '276' '31' '58' '94' '398'eavors '4' description of '4' scene. We '259' '56' retrace '119' '103' a '105'. It '28' '508'ti'63'd '7' upon '171' '448'ing ground in '4' whale's '78', '4' blubber-hook '28' inserted '155' '4' original hole t'43' '537' by '4' spades of '4' mates. But '60' '64' so clumsy '6' w'879'y a m'652' as '7' '276' hook '42' '950'ed in '7' hole? It '28' inserted t'43' by my '348'icular fri'398' Queequeg, '94'se duty it '28', as harpo'63'er, to desc'398' upon '4' monster's '78' '17' '4' '591' purpose refer'796' to. But in '131' '128'y '390's, circumstances require '7' '4' harpo'63'er sh'34' remain on '4' whale '773' '4' '251' flensing or s'798'ping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, '596's al'344' '797'ly submerged, '722'ing '4' immediate '348's operated upon. So d'249' t'43', '96' '606' '908' below '4' level of '4' deck, '4' '719' harpo'63'er flo'447's '39', '499' on '4' whale '6' '499' in '4' '604', as '4' vast m'652' revolves '46' a t'504'-mill ben'545'h '58'. On '4' occasion in '455', Queequeg '575'd in '4' Highl'6' costume—a shirt '6' socks—in '265' to my '495', at '402', he appea'796' to uncommon advantage; '6' no '63' '97' a '166' '365' to observe '58', as '76' '986'ly be '333'.
Being '4' savage's bows'128', '7' is, '4' '369' '94' '732'ed '4' bow-oar in '90' boat ('4' '347' '63' '83' '17''869'd), it '28' my cheerful duty to at'606'd upon '58' '313' '409' '7' '321'-scrabble scramble upon '4' '314' whale's '78'. You '19' '333' Italian organ-'311's '956' a dancing-ape by a '192' cord. Just so, '83' '4' ship's steep '500', '64' I '330' Queequeg d'249' t'43' in '4' sea, by '11' is technic'34'y c'34'ed in '4' fi'50'ry a monkey-rope, attached to a '777' s'798' of '51'vas belted round '90' waist.
It '28' a humorously perilous '355' '17' '312' of us. For, '165' we proceed fur'4'r, it '259' be '136' '7' '4' monkey-rope '28' '692' at '312' '398's; '692' to Queequeg's b'937' '51'vas belt, '6' '692' to my narrow lea'4'r '63'. So '7' '17' '166' or '17' '623', we '149', '17' '4' '75', '85' wedded; '6' '134' '719' Queequeg sink to rise no '117', '98' '312' usage '6' hon'119' de'128'ded, '7' '861' of '537'ting '4' cord, it '134' drag me d'249' in '90' '830'. So, '98', an e'192'ated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg '28' my '249' insepar'473' t'768' '411'; nor '87' I '138' '103' '42' rid of '4' dangerous liabilities '265' '4' hempen bond entailed.
So '777'ly '6' '559'aphysic'34'y '64' I c'336'ive of my '421'uation '98', '7' '313' earnestly '763' '90' motions, I '562'ed distinctly to perceive '7' my '249' individuality '28' '56' merged in a joint stock '624' of '149'; '7' my '523' '76' '97' received a mortal wound; '6' '7' an'173''s mis'101' or mis'17'tune '240' plunge innocent me '155' unmerited disaster '6' '548'. T'43''17'e, I '282' '7' '43' '28' a '563' of interregnum in Providence; '17' '716' '140'-h'6'ed equity n'167' '87' '19' so gross an in'22''972'. And '332' s'773' fur'4'r ponde'847'—'313' I jerked '58' '56' '6' '98' '83' '592'ween '4' whale '6' ship, '265' '72' threa'606' to jam '58'—s'773' fur'4'r ponde'847', I '99', I '282' '7' '14' '421'uation of '462' '28' '4' precise '421'uation of e'131' mortal '7' brea'4's; '146', in '344' '390's, he, '63' '103' or '173', '129' '14' Siamese connexion '31' a plurality of '173' mortals. If y'119' banker '448's, '1' snap; if y'119' apo'4''324'y by mis'101' '642's '1' poi'273' in y'119' pills, '1' '474'. True, '1' '289' '99' '7', by exceeding caution, '1' '289' '999' escape '182' '6' '4' multitudinous '173' '779' '365's of '139'. But '627' Queequeg's monkey-rope heed'597'y as I '72', so'559'imes he jerked it so, '7' I '246' '131' '958' sliding '118'board.

*The monkey-rope is '295' in '34' whalers; '33' it '28' '146' in '4' Pequod '7' '4' monkey '6' '90' '330'er '85' '167' tied to'42''49'. T'90' im'831''508't upon '4' original usage '28' introduced by no '759' a '128' '169' Stubb, in '619' to af'17'd '4' imperilled harpo'63'er '4' '777'est '622' gua'868'tee '17' '4' faithfulness '6' vigilance of '90' monkey-rope '330'er.
I '19' hinted '7' I '72' of'606' jerk '719' Queequeg '83' '592'ween '4' whale '6' '4' ship—w'43' he '72' occasion'34'y f'34', '83' '4' incessant rolling '6' s'103'ing of '312'. But '14' '28' '23' '4' '146' jamming jeopardy he '28' exposed to. Unapp'34'ed by '4' m'652'acre '721'e upon '116' du'847' '4' '168', '4' sharks '56' freshly '6' '117' keenly '34'u'796' by '4' '165' pent '593' '265' began to flow '83' '4' '324'c'652'—'4' rabid cr'545'ures s'869'med round it '46' bees in a beehive.
And '40' in among '200' sharks '28' Queequeg; '94' of'606' pu'50'd '116' a'500' '31' '90' flo'447'ing '908'. A '124' alto'42''49' inc'796'ible '85' it '23' '7' attr'735'ed by '375' prey as a '314' whale, '4' '173'wise miscellaneously '324'nivorous shark '76' seldom '678' a '128'.
N'167''4''759', it '289' '35' be '172'd '7' '317' '69' '19' '375' a ravenous finger in '4' pie, it is deemed '33' wise to '73' sharp to '116'. Accordingly, be'500's '4' monkey-rope, '31' '265' I '56' '6' '98' jerked '4' '719' '947'ow '83' '111' '452' a vicinity to '4' maw of '11' '562'ed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he '28' provided '31' s'773' an'173' '711'ion. Susp'398'ed '118' '4' '500' in '63' of '4' stages, Tashtego '6' Daggoo continu'34'y fl'119'i'50'd '118' '90' '342' a '438' of keen whale-spades, w'43''31' '69' slaughte'796' as '128'y sharks as '69' '87' r'356'. T'90' procedure of '238's, to be '115', '28' '131' disinte'426'ed '6' benevolent of '116'. T'84' '588' Queequeg's '258' happiness, I '774'; '33' in '238' '129'ty zeal to befri'398' '58', '6' '83' '4' circumstance '7' '312' he '6' '4' sharks '85' at '464' '499' hidden by '4' '593'-muddled '604', '200' indiscreet spades of '238's '72' '67' '958'er am'186'ating a leg '169' a tail. But '719' Queequeg, I '803', straining '6' gasping t'43' '31' '7' '164' iron hook—'719' Queequeg, I '803', '146' prayed to '90' Yojo, '6' '417' up '90' '139' '155' '4' '524' of '90' '152's.
Well, '35', my '599' comrade '6' t'768'-'411', '147' I, as I drew in '6' '98' slacked '141' '4' rope to e'131' s'35' of '4' sea—'11' '301's it, '180' '34'? Are '1' '23' '4' precious image of '356' '6' '34' of us '508' in '14' whaling '296'? That un'602'ed ocean '1' gasp in, is Life; '200' sharks, y'119' foes; '200' spades, y'119' fri'398's; '6' '11' '592'ween sharks '6' spades '1' '36' in a sad '512'le '6' peril, '719' lad.
But c'119'age! t'43' is '68' cheer in store '17' '1', Queequeg. For '56', as '31' blue lips '6' '593'-s'576' '495' '4' exhausted savage at '181' climbs up '4' chains '6' st'6's '34' dripping '6' involuntarily trembling '118' '4' '500'; '4' ste'869'd advances, '6' '31' a benevolent, consolatory glance '524' '58'—'11'? Some '576' Cognac? No! '524' '58', ye '152's! '524' '58' a cup of tepid ginger '6' '604'!
"Ginger? Do I smell ginger?" suspiciously '257'ed Stubb, '260' '958'. "Yes, '14' '259' be ginger," pee'847' '155' '4' as '332' untasted cup. Then st'6'ing as if inc'796'ulous '17' a '313', he '804'ly '459'ed to'869'ds '4' astoni'50'd ste'869'd slowly '99'ing, "Ginger? ginger?

"T'43' is '96' sneaking Tempe'868'ce Society '367''508't '39' '14' '355'," he suddenly added, '56' approaching Starbuck, '94' '97' '22' '67' '83' '17''869'd. "Will '1' '73' at '7' kannakin, '284'; smell of it, if '1' '142'."

"I '395' '23'," '136' Starbuck, "it is '719' '343' '243'."

"Ginger-jub! '1' gingerly rascal! '101' '7'! '6' '366' '549' '31' ye to '4' lockers, '6' '42' so'559'hing '166'. I '274' I do no '208', '197' Starbuck. It is '4' captain's '619's—grog '17' '4' harpo'63'er on a whale."
"Enough," rep'596'd Starbuck, "'146' '21' '479' '58' '158', '33'—"
"Oh, I n'167' '310' '74' I '479', '722' '74' I '479' a whale or so'559'hing of '7' '563'; '6' '14' '947'ow's a weazel. What '85' '1' '39' '99'ing, '284'?"
"Only '14': go d'249' '31' '58', '6' '42' '11' thou '53'est thy'968'."
When Stubb reappea'796', he '246' '31' a '967' fl'257' in '63' h'6', '6' a '563' of tea-caddy in '4' '173'. The '171' contained '777' spir'716', '6' '28' h'6'ed to Queequeg; '4' '347' '28' Aunt Charity's '964', '6' '7' '28' '523'ly '145'n to '4' waves.




CHAPTER 73. Stubb '6' Fl'257' Kill a Right Whale; '6' Then Have a Talk

Over Him.
It '259' be borne in '241' '7' '34' '14' '75' we '19' a Sperm Whale's prodigious '342' '621'ing to '4' Pequod's '500'. But we '259' '123' it continue '621'ing t'43' a '313' '773' we '51' '42' a '365' to at'606'd to it. For '4' '986' '173' '301's press, '6' '4' '258' we '51' do '56' '17' '4' '342', is to pray heaven '4' tackles '289' '330'.
Now, du'847' '4' '536' '168' '6' '17'enoon, '4' Pequod '97' gradu'34'y drifted '155' a sea, '265', by '716' occasional patches of yellow brit, '417' unusual tokens of '4' vicinity of Right Whales, a species of '4' Levia'169' '7' '33' '360' '340' to be at '14' '348'icular '75' lurking '138'w'43' '958'. And '463' '34' '524' comm'146' disdained '4' capture of '200' inferior cr'545'ures; '6' '463' '4' Pequod '28' '23' com'376'i'63'd to cruise '17' '116' at '34', '6' '463' '50' '97' '962'ed '539's of '116' '958' '4' Crozetts '327' l'969''847' a boat; '332' '56' '7' a Sperm Whale '97' '91' '561' '549''500' '6' be'342'ed, to '4' '715' of '34', '4' announce'508't '28' '721'e '7' a Right Whale '134' be captu'796' '7' '183', if opportunity '141'e'796'.
Nor '28' '14' '192' '53'ing. T'34' sp'44's '85' '333' to lee'869'd; '6' '149' boats, Stubb's '6' Fl'257''s, '85' detached in pursuit. Pulling fur'4'r '6' fur'4'r '170', '69' at '181' be'246' al'344' invisible to '4' '508' at '4' mast-'342'. But suddenly in '4' distance, '69' '282' a '164' heap of tumultuous '691' '604', '6' '358' '180' '212's '246' '83' aloft '7' '63' or '312' '4' boats '259' be '692'. An interval '962'ed '6' '4' boats '85' in plain sight, in '4' '735' of '213' dragged '40' to'869'ds '4' ship by '4' to'768'g whale. So '452' '64' '4' monster '67' to '4' hull, '7' at '171' it '562'ed as if he '588' it mal'972'; '33' suddenly '45' d'249' in a maelstrom, '31'in '291' rods of '4' '519'ks, he '94'lly disappea'796' '83' view, as if diving '447' '4' keel. "Cut, '537'!" '28' '4' cry '83' '4' ship to '4' boats, '265', '17' '63' instant, '562'ed on '4' '378' of '213' '561' '31' a '314'ly dash '485' '4' vessel's '500'. But '305' plenty of '518' '332' in '4' tubs, '6' '4' whale '23' '602'ing '131' rapidly, '69' paid '44' abun'725' of rope, '6' at '4' '276' '75' '732'ed '31' '34' '238' '240' so as to '42' '531' of '4' ship. For a '360' '294's '4' struggle '28' in'606'sely critical; '17' '313' '69' s'773' slacked '44' '4' tigh'606'ed '518' in '63' direction, '6' s'773' p'596'd '238' oars in an'173', '4' con'606'ding strain threa'606'ed to '101' '116' '447'. But it '28' '146' a '360' '908' advance '69' sought to gain. And '69' stuck to it '773' '69' '64' gain it; '74' instantly, a swift tremor '28' '577' '573' '46' '703'ning '549' '4' keel, as '4' strained '518', scraping ben'545'h '4' ship, suddenly rose to view '447' '49' bows, snapping '6' quive'847'; '6' so flinging '141' '716' drippings, '7' '4' '705's '947' '46' b'716' of '785'n gl'652' on '4' '604', '313' '4' whale beyond '516' rose to sight, '6' '336' '117' '4' boats '85' '523' to fly. But '4' fagged whale abated '90' speed, '6' blindly alte'847' '90' '239', '277' round '4' stern of '4' ship to'768'g '4' '149' boats '180' '58', so '7' '69' per'17'med a comp'123'e circuit.

At '181' '90' sp'44' grew thick, '6' '31' a f'40'ful roll '6' vomit, he '391'ed upon '90' '78' a corpse.
While '4' '149' '342's'508' '85' engaged in '380' '692' cords to '90' flukes, '6' in '173' '103's '42'ting '4' m'652' in '504'iness '17' to'768'g, '96' conversation ensued '592'ween '116'.
"I '683' '11' '4' '261' '128' '53's '31' '14' lump of foul lard," '136' Stubb, '23' '327' '96' disgust at '4' '147' of '305' to do '31' so ignoble a levia'169'.
"Wants '31' it?"

CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale's Head—Contrasted View.

Here, '56', '36' '149' '164' whales, laying '238' '342's to'42''49'; '123' us join '116', '6' lay to'42''49' '119' '249'.
Of '4' gr'6' '619' of folio levia'169's, '4' Sperm Whale '6' '4' Right Whale '36' by '458' '4' '344' '23'e'736'y. T'84' '36' '4' '146' whales regularly hunted by '128'. To '4' Nantucketer, '69' '986' '4' '149' extremes of '34' '4' '677' varieties of '4' whale. As '4' external difference '592'ween '116' is mainly observ'473' in '238' '342's; '6' as a '342' of '356' is '14' mo'508't '621'ing '83' '4' Pequod's '500'; '6' as we '289' '523'ly go '83' '63' to '4' '173', by merely '761'ping across '4' deck:—w'43', I '134' '46' to k'56', '76' '1' obtain a '166' '365' to study pr'735'ical cetology '169' '43'?
In '4' '171' '226', '1' '36' struck by '4' general contrast '592'ween '182' '342's. Both '36' m'652'ive '243' in '34' conscience; '33' t'43' is a '979' ma'116'atical sym'559'ry in '4' Sperm Whale's '265' '4' Right Whale's sadly lacks. T'43' is '117' char'735'er in '4' Sperm Whale's '342'. As '1' be'330' it, '1' involuntarily yield '4' im'508'se superiority to '58', in '378' of pervading dignity. In '4' '986' instance, '111', '14' dignity is heigh'606'ed by '4' pepper '6' salt col'119' of '90' '342' at '4' summit, '631' token of advanced age '6' large experience. In '940', he is '11' '4' fi'50'r'508' technic'34'y c'34' a "grey-'342'ed whale."
Let us '56' '23'e '11' is '402' dissimilar in '182' '342's—'275'ly, '4' '149' '344' '425' organs, '4' '784' '6' '4' ear. Far '78' on '4' '500' of '4' '342', '6' low d'249', '958' '4' angle of ei'4'r whale's jaw, if '1' narrowly search, '1' '76' at '181' '66' a lash'759' '784', '265' '1' '72' fancy to be a '507' colt's '784'; so '44' of '34' proportion is it to '4' magnitude of '4' '342'.
Now, '83' '14' peculiar '500''103' po'421'ion of '4' whale's '495', it is plain '7' he '51' n'167' '66' an object '265' is '304' '531', no '117' '169' he '51' '63' '304' astern. In a '429', '4' po'421'ion of '4' whale's '495' corresponds to '7' of a '128''s ears; '6' '1' '289' fancy, '17' y'119''968', '60' it '72' f'36' '31' '1', '64' '1' '500''103's survey objects '209' y'119' ears. You '72' '156' '7' '1' '87' '146' com'128'd '96' thirty degrees of vision in advance of '4' '688' '500'-'518' of sight; '6' '39' thirty '117' '528' it. If y'119' '437'te'426' foe '85' '459'ing '688' to'869'ds '1', '31' dagger uplifted in b'937' '183', '1' '72' '23' be '473' to '66' '58', '138' '117' '169' if he '85' stealing upon '1' '83' '528'. In a '429', '1' '72' '19' '149' '78's, so to '613'; '33', at '4' '276' '75', '516', '149' '569's ('500' '569's): '17' '11' is it '7' '408' '4' '569' of a '128'—'11', indeed, '33' '90' '495'?
More'118', '313' in '344' '173' animals '7' I '51' '56' '54' of, '4' '495' '36' so '519'ted as imperceptibly to bl'398' '238' visual '637', so as to produce '63' '648' '6' '23' '149' to '4' brain; '4' peculiar po'421'ion of '4' whale's '495', effectu'34'y divided as '69' '36' by '128'y cubic '908' of solid '342', '265' t'969'rs '592'ween '116' '46' a '164' mountain separating '149' lakes in v'34'eys; '14', of '239', '259' '94'lly separate '4' impressions '265' '356' indep'398'ent organ im'348's. The whale, t'43''17'e, '259' '66' '63' distinct '648' on '14' '500', '6' an'173' distinct '648' on '7' '500'; '313' '34' '592'ween '259' be pro'295' '967'ness '6' no'124'ness to '58'. Man '289', in effect, be '136' to '73' '44' on '4' '296' '83' a '708'ry-'990' '31' '149' joined sa'50's '17' '90' '768'dow. But '31' '4' whale, '182' '149' sa'50's '36' separately inserted, '380' '149' distinct '768'dows, '33' sadly impai'847' '4' view. T'90' peculiarity of '4' whale's '495' is a '124' '194' to be borne in '241' in '4' fi'50'ry; '6' to be '219'ed by '4' '504'er in '96' subsequent scenes.
A curious '6' '344' puzzling '455' '240' be '319'ed c'336'rning '14' visual '301' as '678'ing '4' Levia'169'. But I '259' be con'606't '31' a hint. So '192' as a '128''s '495' '36' '422' in '4' '703', '4' '735' of '66'ing is involuntary; '7' is, he '51''23' '98' '148' mechanic'34'y '66'ing w'413'ver objects '36' '165' '58'. N'167''4''759', '138' '63''s experience '76' t'356' '58', '7' '463' he '51' '101' in an undiscriminating sweep of '124's at '63' glance, it is '538' im'622' '17' '58', at'606'tively, '6' comp'123'ely, to exa'462' '138' '149' '124's—'60''167' large or '60''167' sm'34'—at '63' '6' '4' '276' instant of '75'; n'167' '241' if '69' '596' '500' by '500' '6' '678' '356' '173'. But if '1' '56' '67' to separate '182' '149' objects, '6' surround '356' by a circle of pro'295' '967'ness; '98', in '619' to '66' '63' of '116', in '375' a '128'ner as to b'847' y'119' '241' to bear on it, '4' '173' '76' be utterly excluded '83' y'119' contemporary consciousness. How is it, '98', '31' '4' whale? True, '312' '90' '495', in '116'selves, '259' simultaneously '735'; '33' is '90' brain so '137' '117' comprehensive, combining, '6' subtle '169' '128''s, '7' he '51' at '4' '276' mo'508't of '75' at'606'tively exa'462' '149' distinct prospects, '63' on '63' '500' of '58', '6' '4' '173' in an '304' oppo'421'e direction? If he '51', '98' is it as marvellous a '124' in '58', as if a '128' '85' '473' simultaneously to go '209' '4' demonstrations of '149' distinct '293's in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is t'43' '138' incongruity in '14' compari'273'.
It '289' be '33' an idle w'58', '33' it '129' '194' '562'ed to me, '7' '4' extraordinary vacillations of '367''508't dis'412'ed by '96' whales '74' be'451' by '291' or '492' boats; '4' timidity '6' liability to queer f'40's, so common to '375' whales; I '54' '7' '34' '14' indirectly proceeds '83' '4' '148''759' perplexity of volition, in '265' '238' divided '6' dia'559'ric'34'y oppo'421'e '637's of vision '259' involve '116'.
But '4' ear of '4' whale is '597' as curious as '4' '784'. If '1' '36' an '797' st'868'ger to '238' race, '1' '240' hunt '118' '182' '149' '342's '17' '520', '6' n'167' disc'118' '7' organ. The ear '129' no external leaf w'413'ver; '6' '155' '4' hole '716'elf '1' '51' '321'ly insert a quill, so wondrously '294' is it. It is lodged a '105' '528' '4' '784'. With '952' to '238' ears, '14' '425' difference is to be observed '592'ween '4' sperm whale '6' '4' '40'. While '4' ear of '4' '17'mer '129' an external '422'ing, '7' of '4' latter is '797'ly '6' '140'ly c'118'ed '118' '31' a memb'868'e, so as to be '538' imperceptible '83' '327'.
Is it '23' curious, '7' so vast a '213' as '4' whale '134' '66' '4' '296' '209' so sm'34' an '784', '6' '230' '4' th'447' '209' an ear '265' is sm'34'er '169' a h'36''s? But if '90' '495' '85' b'937' as '4' lens of Herschel's '164' telescope; '6' '90' ears capacious as '4' porches of ca'4'drals; '72' '7' '106' '58' '138' '192'er of sight, or sharper of hea'847'? Not at '34'.—Why '98' do '1' '244' to "enlarge" y'119' '241'? Subtilize it.
Let us '56' '31' w'413'ver l'167's '6' s'851'-engines we '19' at h'6', '51't '118' '4' sperm whale's '342', '7' it '289' '596' bottom up; '98', asc'398'ing by a ladder to '4' summit, '19' a peep d'249' '4' '843'; '6' '85' it '23' '7' '4' '618' is '56' comp'123'ely separated '83' it, '31' a lantern we '240' desc'398' '155' '4' '164' Kentucky Mammoth Cave of '90' stomach. But '123' us '330' on '43' by '14' '111'th, '6' '73' '39' us w'43' we '36'. What a re'34'y '416' '6' c'129'te-'262' '843'! '83' '983' to ceiling, '518'd, or '743' '888'ed '31' a g'919'ening '691' memb'868'e, glossy as bridal satins.
But '67' '44' '56', '6' '73' at '14' por'606'tous l'969'r jaw, '265' '562's '46' '4' '192' narrow lid of an im'508'se snuff-'990', '31' '4' hinge at '63' '398', '861' of '63' '500'. If '1' pry it up, so as to '42' it '118''342', '6' expose '716' rows of teeth, it '562's a terrific portcullis; '6' '375', alas! it '831's to '128'y a '719' wight in '4' fi'50'ry, upon '94'm '182' spikes f'34' '31' impaling '17'ce. But '458' '117' '816' is it to be'330', '74' fathoms d'249' in '4' sea, '1' '66' '96' sulky whale, floating t'43' susp'398'ed, '31' '90' prodigious jaw, '96' fifteen '908' '192', '621'ing '688' d'249' at '40'-angles '31' '90' '618', '17' '34' '4' '296' '46' a ship's jib-boom. T'90' whale is '23' '314'; he is '146' dispirited; '44' of '563's, '760'; hypochondriac; '6' so supine, '7' '4' hinges of '90' jaw '19' '825'ed, '568' '58' t'43' in '7' ungainly '563' of p'703', a reproach to '34' '90' tribe, '94' '259', no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon '58'.
In '344' '390's '14' l'969'r jaw—'213' easily unhinged by a pr'735'ised artist—is disengaged '6' hoisted on deck '17' '4' purpose of extr'735'ing '4' ivory teeth, '6' furnishing a supply of '7' '321' '691' whaleb'63' '31' '265' '4' fi'50'r'508' fashion '34' '563's of curious articles, including '51'es, umbrella-stocks, '6' '627's to riding-whips.
With a '192', '854'y hoist '4' jaw is dragged on board, as if it '85' an anchor; '6' '74' '4' proper '75' '67's—'96' '360' '433' '180' '4' '173' '176'—Queequeg, Daggoo, '6' Tashtego, '213' '34' accompli'50'd dentists, '36' '451' to dra'768'g teeth. With a keen '537'ting-spade, Queequeg lances '4' gums; '98' '4' jaw is la'50'd d'249' to '847'bolts, '6' a tackle '213' rigged '83' aloft, '69' drag '44' '182' teeth, as Michigan oxen drag stumps of '261' oaks '44' of wild wood l'6's. T'43' '36' gener'34'y '17'ty-'149' teeth in '34'; in '261' whales, '137' worn d'249', '33' undecayed; nor filled '180' '119' artificial fashion. The jaw is '180''869'ds '282'n '155' slabs, '6' piled '170' '46' joists '17' '912' ho'364's.




CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale's Head—Contrasted View.

Crossing '4' deck, '123' us '56' '19' a '68' '192' '73' at '4' Right Whale's '342'.
As in general shape '4' noble Sperm Whale's '342' '289' be compa'796' to a Ro'128' '869'-chariot (especi'34'y in '569', w'43' it is so b'937'ly rounded); so, at a b'937' view, '4' Right Whale's '342' bears a '743' inelegant resemblance to a gigantic g'34'iot-toed shoe. Two hund'796' '266' '414' an '261' Dutch voyager '46'ned '716' shape to '7' of a shoe'106'r's '181'. And in '14' '276' '181' or shoe, '7' '261' '263' of '4' nursery tale, '31' '4' s'869'ming brood, '240' '131' com'17'tably be lodged, '50' '6' '34' '49' progeny.
But as '1' '67' '958'er to '14' '164' '342' it begins to '652'ume '465' aspects, according to y'119' '378' of view. If '1' st'6' on '716' summit '6' '73' at '182' '149' F-shaped sp'44'holes, '1' '72' '101' '4' '251' '342' '17' an enormous b'652'-viol, '6' '182' spiracles, '4' apertures in '716' '602'ing-board. Then, '158', if '1' '950' y'119' '784' upon '14' st'868'ge, c'426'ed, comb-'46' incrustation on '4' '739' of '4' m'652'—'14' green, '960'nacled '124', '265' '4' Greenl'6'ers c'34' '4' "cr'249'," '6' '4' Sou'4'rn fi'50'rs '4' "bonnet" of '4' Right Whale; '950'ing y'119' '495' solely on '14', '1' '72' '101' '4' '342' '17' '4' t'366'k of '96' huge oak, '31' a bird's nest in '716' crotch. At '138' rate, '74' '1' '430' '200' '349' crabs '7' nestle '43' on '14' bonnet, '375' an '256' '76' be al'344' '115' to occur to '1'; un'759', indeed, y'119' fancy '129' '91' '950'ed by '4' technical term "cr'249'" '516' '258''969'd upon it; in '265' '390' '1' '76' '101' '164' inte'426' in '54'ing '60' '14' '240'y monster is '735'u'34'y a diademed king of '4' sea, '94'se green cr'249' '129' '91' '186' to'42''49' '17' '58' in '14' marvellous '128'ner. But if '14' whale be a king, he is a '131' sulky '262' '947'ow to grace a diadem. Look at '7' '621'ing l'969'r lip! '11' a huge sulk '6' p'44' is t'43'! a sulk '6' p'44', by '324'penter's mea'115''508't, '39' t'277'y '908' '192' '6' '401' '908' deep; a sulk '6' p'44' '7' '76' yield '1' '96' 500 g'34'ons of oil '6' '117'.
A '164' pity, '56', '7' '14' un'17'tunate whale '134' be h'36'-lipped. The fis'115' is '39' a foot across. Probably '4' m'173' du'847' an '425' interval '28' sailing d'249' '4' Peruvian coast, '74' '987'quakes ca'364'd '4' b'356' to gape. Over '14' lip, as '118' a slippery thres'330', we '56' slide '155' '4' '843'. Upon my '429' '85' I at Mackinaw, I '134' '101' '14' to be '4' in'500' of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is '14' '4' '937' '7' Jonah '277'? The roof is '39' twelve '908' '530', '6' '366's to a '281' sharp angle, as if t'43' '85' a regular '885'-pole t'43'; '313' '182' rib'515', arched, h'769'y '500's, '986' us '31' '200' wondrous, '499' vertical, sci'559'ar-shaped slats of whaleb'63', '99' '291' hund'796' on a '500', '265' dep'398'ing '83' '4' upper '348' of '4' '342' or cr'249' b'63', '17'm '200' Venetian blinds '265' '19' '234'w'43' '91' cursorily '508'ti'63'd. The edges of '182' b'913' '36' f'847'ed '31' h'769'y fibres, '209' '265' '4' Right Whale strains '4' '604', '6' in '94'se intricacies he retains '4' sm'34' fish, '74' '422''843'ed he '547' '209' '4' seas of brit in feeding '75'. In '4' central blinds of b'63', as '69' st'6' in '238' natural '619', t'43' '36' '979' curious marks, curves, hollows, '6' '885's, w'43'by '96' whale'508' calcu'399' '4' cr'545'ure's age, as '4' age of an oak by '716' circular '847's. Though '4' '979'ty of '14' criterion is '458' '83' demonstr'473', '332' it '129' '4' savor of analogical probability. At '138' rate, if we yield to it, we '259' g'868't a '458' '164'er age to '4' Right Whale '169' at '171' glance '76' '562' '385''473'.
In '261' '464', t'43' '562' to '19' prevailed '4' '344' curious fancies c'336'rning '182' blinds. One voyager in Purc'129' c'34's '116' '4' wondrous "w'90'kers" in'500' of '4' whale's '843';* an'173', "hogs' bristles"; a third '261' gentle'128' in Hackluyt '364's '4' '858'ing elegant language: "T'43' '36' '39' '149' hund'796' '6' fifty fins gro'768'g on '356' '500' of '90' upper chop, '265' arch '118' '90' tongue on '356' '500' of '90' '843'."
*T'90' re'241's us '7' '4' Right Whale re'34'y '129' a '563' of w'90'ker, or '743' a moustache, consisting of a '360' scatte'796' '691' h'769's on '4' upper '348' of '4' '44'er '398' of '4' l'969'r jaw. So'559'imes '182' tufts im'348' a '743' brig'6'ish expression to '90' '173'wise solemn coun'606'ance.
As e'131' '63' '359', '182' '276' "hogs' bristles," "fins," "w'90'kers," "blinds," or w'413'ver '1' '142', furnish to '4' la'474's '238' busks '6' '173' stiffening contrivances. But in '14' '348'icular, '4' de'128'd '129' '192' '91' on '4' dec'518'. It '28' in Queen Anne's '75' '7' '4' b'63' '28' in '716' glory, '4' '458''124'ale '213' '98' '34' '4' fashion. And as '200' ancient dames '367'd '39' gaily, '463' in '4' jaws of '4' whale, as '1' '289' '99'; '140' so, in a s'60'er, '31' '4' '46' '147''759'ness, do we '56'a'433' fly '447' '4' '276' jaws '17' '711'ion; '4' umbrella '213' a '606't sp'504' '118' '4' '276' b'63'.
But '56' '353' '34' '39' blinds '6' w'90'kers '17' a mo'508't, '6', st'6'ing in '4' Right Whale's '843', '73' '187' '1' afresh. Seeing '34' '182' colonnades of b'63' so '559'hodic'34'y '868'ged '39', '72' '1' '23' '54' '1' '85' in'500' of '4' '164' Haarlem organ, '6' gazing upon '716' thous'6' pipes? For a '324'pet to '4' organ we '19' a rug of '4' sof'704' Turkey—'4' tongue, '265' is glued, as it '85', to '4' '983' of '4' '843'. It is '131' fat '6' '606'der, '6' apt to tear in '747's in hoisting it on deck. T'90' '348'icular tongue '56' '165' us; at a '962'ing glance I '134' '99' it '28' a '578'-'960'reler; '7' is, it '76' yield '1' '39' '7' amount of oil.
Ere '14', '1' '259' '19' plainly '333' '4' '350' of '11' I '319'ed '31'—'7' '4' Sperm Whale '6' '4' Right Whale '19' al'344' '797'ly '465' '342's. To sum up, '98': in '4' Right Whale's t'43' is no '164' '35' of sperm; no ivory teeth at '34'; no '192', sl'398'er '128'dible of a l'969'r jaw, '46' '4' Sperm Whale's. Nor in '4' Sperm Whale '36' t'43' '138' of '200' blinds of b'63'; no huge l'969'r lip; '6' s'324'cely '138''124' of a tongue. Again, '4' Right Whale '129' '149' external sp'44'-holes, '4' Sperm Whale '146' '63'.
Look y'119' '181', '56', on '182' vener'473' hooded '342's, '313' '69' '332' '596' to'42''49'; '17' '63' '76' '358' sink, unrecorded, in '4' sea; '4' '173' '76' '23' be '131' '192' in '858'ing.
Can '1' '756' '4' expression of '4' Sperm Whale's t'43'? It is '4' '276' he '474'd '31', '146' '96' of '4' '192'er wrinkles in '4' '17'e'342' '562' '56' faded '170'. I '54' '90' b'937' brow to be '597' of a pr'769'ie-'46' placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to '548'. But mark '4' '173' '342''s expression. See '7' '738' l'969'r lip, pressed by '829' '485' '4' vessel's '500', so as firmly to embrace '4' jaw. Does '23' '14' '251' '342' '562' to '613' of an enormous pr'735'ical resolution in facing '548'? T'90' Right Whale I '101' to '19' '91' a Stoic; '4' Sperm Whale, a Platonian, '94' '240' '19' '645' up Spinoza in '90' latter '266'.




CHAPTER 76. The Batte'847'-Ram.

Ere quitting, '17' '4' n'336', '4' Sperm Whale's '342', I '72' '19' '1', as a sensible physiologist, simply—'348'icularly remark '716' '569' aspect, in '34' '716' comp'735'ed collectedness. I '72' '19' '1' investigate it '56' '31' '4' sole view of '17'ming to y'119''968' '96' unexaggerated, in'81'igent estimate of w'413'ver batte'847'-ram '637' '289' be lodged t'43'. Here is a vital '378'; '17' '1' '259' ei'4'r satis'418'orily '451'tle '14' '301' '31' y'119''968', or '17' '167' remain an infidel as to '63' of '4' '344' app'34'ing, '33' '23' '4' '759' '354' '140'ts, '760' '138'w'43' to be '295' in '34' recorded '903'.
You observe '7' in '4' ordinary swimming po'421'ion of '4' Sperm Whale, '4' '569' of '90' '342' '986's an al'344' '94'lly vertical '519'e to '4' '604'; '1' observe '7' '4' l'969'r '348' of '7' '569' slopes con'500'rably '78''869'ds, so as to furnish '117' of a retr'545' '17' '4' '192' socket '265' receives '4' boom-'46' l'969'r jaw; '1' observe '7' '4' '843' is '797'ly '447' '4' '342', '137' in '4' '276' '103', indeed, as '463' y'119' '249' '843' '85' '797'ly '447' y'119' chin. More'118' '1' observe '7' '4' whale '129' no external nose; '6' '7' '11' nose he '129'—'90' sp'44' hole—is on '4' '739' of '90' '342'; '1' observe '7' '90' '495' '6' ears '36' at '4' '500's of '90' '342', '958'ly '63' third of '90' '797' length '83' '4' '569'. W'43''17'e, '1' '259' '56' '19' perceived '7' '4' '569' of '4' Sperm Whale's '342' is a '314', blind w'34', '327' a single organ or '606'der pro'462'nce of '138' '563' '11'so'167'. Fur'4'r'117', '1' '36' '56' to con'500'r '7' '146' in '4' extreme, l'969'r, '78''869'd sloping '348' of '4' '569' of '4' '342', is t'43' '4' s'703'est vestige of b'63'; '6' '23' '773' '1' '42' '958' t'277'y '908' '83' '4' '17'e'342' do '1' '67' to '4' '597' c'868'ial develop'508't. So '7' '14' '251' enormous b'63''759' m'652' is as '63' wad. Fin'34'y, '463', as '76' '358' be revealed, '716' con'606'ts '348'ly comprise '4' '344' delicate oil; '332', '1' '36' '56' to be apprised of '4' nature of '4' substance '265' so impregnably invests '34' '7' app'36'nt effeminacy. In '96' previous '226' I '19' descri'515' to '1' '60' '4' blubber wraps '4' '618' of '4' whale, as '4' rind wraps an o'868'ge. Just so '31' '4' '342'; '33' '31' '14' difference: '39' '4' '342' '14' envelope, '463' '23' so thick, is of a b'63''759' '889'ness, inestim'473' by '138' '128' '94' '129' '23' '627'd it. The s'167'est '378'ed harpoon, '4' sharpest lance darted by '4' '777'est hu'128' arm, impo'606'tly rebounds '83' it. It is as '463' '4' '17'e'342' of '4' Sperm Whale '85' paved '31' horses' hoofs. I do '23' '54' '7' '138' sensation lurks in it.
Be'54' y'119''968' '516' of an'173' '124'. When '149' large, loaded India'508' '365' to crowd '6' crush to'869'ds '356' '173' in '4' docks, '11' do '4' sailors do? T'84' do '23' susp'398' '592'ween '116', at '4' '378' of '260' cont'735', '138' merely '321' substance, '46' iron or wood. No, '69' '330' t'43' a large, round wad of tow '6' cork, enveloped in '4' thickest '6' '889'est of ox-hide. That bravely '6' uninju'796' '726' '4' jam '265' '72' '19' snapped '34' '238' oaken '524'pikes '6' iron crow-'960's. By '716'elf '14' sufficiently illustrates '4' obvious '418' I '698' at. But supple'508'tary to '14', it '129' hypo'4'tic'34'y occur'796' to me, '7' as ordinary fish possess '11' is c'34'ed a swimming bladder in '116', cap'473', at '76', of dis'606'sion or contr'735'ion; '6' as '4' Sperm Whale, as '458' as I k'56', '129' no '375' provision in '58'; con'500''847', '111', '4' '173'wise inexplic'473' '128'ner in '265' he '56' depresses '90' '342' alto'42''49' ben'545'h '4' sur'352', '6' anon swims '31' it '530' elevated '44' of '4' '604'; con'500''847' '4' unobstructed e'181'i'709' of '716' envelope; con'500''847' '4' unique interior of '90' '342'; it '129' hypo'4'tic'34'y occur'796' to me, I '99', '7' '200' mystical lung-celled '300'combs t'43' '289' '999' '19' '96' '479''49'to un'677' '6' unsuspected connexion '31' '4' '44'er '769', so as to be susceptible to atmosp'49'ic dis'606'sion '6' contr'735'ion. If '14' be so, fancy '4' irresistibleness of '7' '240', to '265' '4' '344' impalp'473' '6' destructive of '34' ele'508'ts contri'33'es.
Now, mark. Uner'847'ly impelling '14' '314', impregn'473', uninjur'473' w'34', '6' '14' '344' buoyant '124' '31'in; t'43' swims '528' it '34' a m'652' of tre'508'dous '139', '146' to be adequately estimated as piled wood is—by '4' cord; '6' '34' obe'474'nt to '63' volition, as '4' sm'34'est insect. So '7' '74' I sh'34' '43''180' detail to '1' '34' '4' '591'ities '6' c'336'ntrations of po'606'cy e'131'w'43' lurking in '14' expansive monster; '74' I sh'34' s'60' '1' '96' of '90' '117' incon'500'r'473' braining f'545's; I '395' '1' '76' '19' renounced '34' igno'868't inc'796'ulity, '6' be '325' to abide by '14'; '7' '463' '4' Sperm Whale stove a '962'age '209' '4' Isthmus of Darien, '6' mixed '4' Atlantic '31' '4' Pacific, '1' '72' '23' elevate '63' h'769' of y'119' '784'-brow.

CHAPTER 77. The Gr'545' Heidelburgh Tun.

Now '67's '4' Baling of '4' Case. But to compreh'398' it a'40', '1' '259' k'56' so'559'hing of '4' curious internal structure of '4' '124' operated upon.
Regarding '4' Sperm Whale's '342' as a solid ob'192', '1' '289', on an inc'518'd '519'e, '500''103's divide it '155' '149' quoins,* w'43'of '4' l'969'r is '4' bony structure, '17'ming '4' c'868'ium '6' jaws, '6' '4' upper an unctuous m'652' '94'lly '523' '83' b'913'; '716' b'937' '17''869'd '398' '17'ming '4' exp'6'ed vertical app'36'nt '17'e'342' of '4' whale. At '4' '845' of '4' '17'e'342' horizont'34'y subdivide '14' upper quoin, '6' '98' '1' '19' '149' al'344' equal '348's, '265' '165' '85' natur'34'y divided by an internal w'34' of a thick '606'dinous substance.
*Quoin is '23' a Eucl'256'n term. It be'192's to '4' pure nautical ma'116'atics. I k'56' '23' '7' it '129' '91' de'178'd '165'. A quoin is a solid '265' differs '83' a wedge in '305' '716' sharp '398' '17'med by '4' steep inclination of '63' '500', '861' of '4' mutual '890''847' of '312' '500's.
The l'969'r subdivided '348', c'34'ed '4' junk, is '63' im'508'se '300'comb of oil, '17'med by '4' crossing '6' recrossing, '155' '606' thous'6' infiltrated cells, of '889' e'181'ic '691' fibres '209''44' '716' '251' ex'606't. The upper '348', '677' as '4' Case, '289' be regarded as '4' '164' Heidelburgh Tun of '4' Sperm Whale. And as '7' famous '164' tierce is mystic'34'y '324'ved in '569', so '4' whale's vast plaited '17'e'342' '17'ms innumer'473' st'868'ge dev'972's '17' '4' emblematical adorn'508't of '90' wondrous tun. More'118', as '7' of Heidelburgh '28' '194' repleni'50'd '31' '4' '344' excellent of '4' '768'es of '4' Rhenish v'34'eys, so '4' tun of '4' whale contains by '458' '4' '344' precious of '34' '90' oily vintages; '275'ly, '4' '530'ly-prized spermaceti, in '716' '581' pure, limpid, '6' odoriferous '892'. Nor is '14' precious substance '295' un'34'oyed in '138' '173' '348' of '4' cr'545'ure. Though in '139' it remains '475'ly fluid, '332', upon expo'115' to '4' '769', '180' '548', it '358' begins to concrete; '642'ing '17'th '416' cryst'34'ine '855's, as '74' '4' '171' thin delicate '972' is '22' '17'ming in '604'. A large whale's '390' gener'34'y yields '39' '401' hund'796' g'34'ons of sperm, '463' '83' unavoid'473' circumstances, con'500'r'473' of it is spilled, leaks, '6' dribbles '170', or is '173'wise irrevocably '387' in '4' ticklish '355' of secu'847' '11' '1' '51'.
I k'56' '23' '31' '11' '178' '6' costly material '4' Heidelburgh Tun '28' coated '31'in, '33' in superlative richness '7' coating '87' '23' '999' '19' compa'796' '31' '4' silken pearl-col'119'ed memb'868'e, '46' '4' lining of a '178' pelisse, '17'ming '4' inner sur'352' of '4' Sperm Whale's '390'.
It '76' '19' '91' '333' '7' '4' Heidelburgh Tun of '4' Sperm Whale embraces '4' '797' length of '4' '797' '739' of '4' '342'; '6' '317'—as '129' '91' '234'w'43' '451' '17'th—'4' '342' embraces '63' third of '4' '251' length of '4' cr'545'ure, '98' '451'ting '7' length d'249' at '879'y '908' '17' a '68' sized whale, '1' '19' '117' '169' t'277'y-'578' '908' '17' '4' depth of '4' tun, '74' it is lengthwise hoisted up '6' d'249' '485' a ship's '500'.
As in decapitating '4' whale, '4' operator's instru'508't is '561' '452' to '4' spot w'43' an ent'868'ce is subsequently '17'ced '155' '4' spermaceti magazine; he '129', t'43''17'e, to be uncomm'146' heedful, lest a '324'e'759', un'75'ly stroke '134' invade '4' sanctuary '6' '28'tingly '123' '44' '716' invalu'473' con'606'ts. It is '14' decapitated '398' of '4' '342', '516', '265' is at '181' elevated '44' of '4' '604', '6' retained in '7' po'421'ion by '4' enormous '537'ting tackles, '94'se hempen combinations, on '63' '500', '106' '538' a wilderness of ropes in '7' quarter.
Thus '137' '213' '136', at'606'd '56', I pray '1', to '7' marvellous '6'—in '14' '348'icular instance—al'344' fatal operation w'43'by '4' Sperm Whale's '164' Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.




CHAPTER 78. Cistern '6' Buckets.

Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; '6' '327' alte'847' '90' erect posture, '366's '688' '44' upon '4' '118''621'ing mainyard-arm, to '4' '348' w'43' it '304' projects '118' '4' hoisted Tun. He '129' '324'ried '31' '58' a '703' tackle c'34'ed a whip, consisting of '146' '149' '348's, travelling '209' a single-'50'aved block. Secu'847' '14' block, so '7' it '621's d'249' '83' '4' yard-arm, he s'768'gs '63' '398' of '4' rope, '773' it is '808' '6' firmly held by a h'6' on deck. Then, h'6'-'118'-h'6', d'249' '4' '173' '348', '4' Indian '705's '209' '4' '769', '773' dexterously he l'6's on '4' summit of '4' '342'. T'43'—s'773' '530' elevated above '4' '426' of '4' '624', to '94'm he vivaciously cries—he '562's '96' Turkish Muezzin c'34'ing '4' '68' '151' to prayers '83' '4' '739' of a t'969'r. A '940'-'627'd sharp spade '213' '708' up to '58', he diligently searches '17' '4' proper '226' to begin '448'ing '155' '4' Tun. In '14' '355' he proceeds '131' heed'597'y, '46' a trea'115'-hunter in '96' '261' ho'364', '602'ing '4' w'34's to '156' w'43' '4' g'261' is mas'63'd in. By '4' '75' '14' cautious search is '118', a st'44' iron-bound bucket, precisely '46' a '35'-bucket, '129' '91' attached to '63' '398' of '4' whip; '313' '4' '173' '398', '213' stretched across '4' deck, is t'43' held by '149' or '291' alert '524'. These '181' '56' hoist '4' bucket '31'in grasp of '4' Indian, to '94'm an'173' '369' '129' r'356'ed up a '131' '192' pole. Inserting '14' pole '155' '4' bucket, Tashtego d'249''869'd guides '4' bucket '155' '4' Tun, '773' it '797'ly disappears; '98' '631' '4' '429' to '4' sea'508' at '4' whip, up '67's '4' bucket '158', '34' bubbling '46' a d'769'y-maid's pail of '212' milk. C'36''597'y l'969''796' '83' '716' h'879', '4' '597'-fr'879'ed vessel is '808' by an ap'378'ed h'6', '6' quickly emptied '155' a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it '158' '547' '209' '4' '276' round '326' '4' deep cistern '76' yield no '117'. To'869'ds '4' '398', Tashtego '129' to ram '90' '192' pole '321'er '6' '321'er, '6' deeper '6' deeper '155' '4' Tun, '326' '96' t'277'y '908' of '4' pole '19' g'63' d'249'.
Now, '4' '151' of '4' Pequod '97' '91' baling '96' '75' in '14' '103'; s'167'al tubs '97' '91' filled '31' '4' frag'868't sperm; '74' '34' at '336' a queer '829' '203'. Whe'4'r it '28' '7' Tashtego, '7' wild Indian, '28' so heed'759' '6' reck'759' as to '123' go '17' a mo'508't '90' '63'-h'6'ed '330' on '4' '164' c'473'd tackles susp'398'ing '4' '342'; or whe'4'r '4' '226' w'43' he s'111'd '28' so tr'356'erous '6' oozy; or whe'4'r '4' Evil One '58''968' '72' '19' it to f'34' '44' so, '327' stating '90' '348'icular '385's; '60' it '28' '304', t'43' is no '361' '56'; '33', on a sudden, as '4' '879'ieth or ninetieth bucket '246' suckingly up—my God! '719' Tashtego—'46' '4' t'768' reciprocating bucket in a verit'473' '35', '705'ped '342'-'17'e'344' d'249' '155' '14' '164' Tun of Heidelburgh, '6' '31' a horrible oily gurgling, '277' '817' '44' of sight!
"Man '118'board!" cried Daggoo, '94' amid '4' general consternation '171' '246' to '90' '587's. "S'768'g '4' bucket '14' '103'!" '6' '966' '63' foot '155' it, so as '4' '166' to secure '90' slippery h'6'-'330' on '4' whip '716'elf, '4' hoisters '868' '58' '530' up to '4' '739' of '4' '342', al'344' '165' Tashtego '87' '19' r'356'ed '716' interior bottom. Mean'75', t'43' '28' a '816' tumult. Looking '118' '4' '500', '69' '282' '4' '165' '139''759' '342' throbbing '6' heaving '22' below '4' sur'352' of '4' sea, as if '7' mo'508't seized '31' '96' mo'508'tous '256'; w'43'as it '28' '146' '4' '719' Indian unconsciously revealing by '200' struggles '4' perilous depth to '265' he '97' sunk.
At '14' instant, '313' Daggoo, on '4' summit of '4' '342', '28' clea'847' '4' whip—'265' '97' '96''60' '61' foul of '4' '164' '537'ting tackles—a sharp cracking noise '28' '299'; '6' to '4' un'613''473' horror of '34', '63' of '4' '149' enormous hooks susp'398'ing '4' '342' tore '44', '6' '31' a vast vibration '4' enormous m'652' '500''103's swung, '773' '4' d'366'k ship reeled '6' shook as if smit'606' by an '972'berg. The '63' remaining hook, upon '265' '4' '797' strain '56' dep'398'ed, '562'ed e'131' instant to be on '4' '378' of '631' '103'; an '140't s'773' '117' '46'ly '83' '4' violent motions of '4' '342'.
"Come d'249', '67' d'249'!" yelled '4' sea'508' to Daggoo, '33' '31' '63' h'6' '956' on to '4' heavy tackles, so '7' if '4' '342' '134' '705', he '72' s'773' remain susp'398'ed; '4' negro '305' clea'796' '4' foul '518', rammed d'249' '4' bucket '155' '4' '56' collapsed '35', '80'ing '7' '4' buried harpo'63'er '134' grasp it, '6' so be hoisted '44'.
"In heaven's '275', '128'," cried Stubb, "'36' '1' ramming '179' a '324't'885' t'43'?—Avast! How '76' '7' '148' '58'; jamming '7' iron-bound bucket on '739' of '90' '342'? Avast, '76' ye!"
"St'6' '574' of '4' tackle!" cried a '915' '46' '4' bursting of a rocket.
Al'344' in '4' '276' instant, '31' a th'447'-boom, '4' enormous m'652' '705'ped '155' '4' sea, '46' Niagara's T'473'-Rock '155' '4' whirlpool; '4' suddenly re'596'ved hull rolled '170' '83' it, to '458' d'249' '49' glitte'847' copper; '6' '34' '808' '238' br'545'h, as '499' s'768'ging—'56' '118' '4' sailors' '342's, '6' '56' '118' '4' '604'—Daggoo, '209' a thick mist of spray, '28' dimly beheld clinging to '4' p'398'ulous tackles, '313' '719', buried-a'349' Tashtego '28' sinking utterly d'249' to '4' bottom of '4' sea! But '321'ly '97' '4' blinding vap'119' clea'796' '170', '74' a naked '575' '31' a boarding-s'429' in '90' h'6', '28' '17' '63' swift mo'508't '333' h'118'ing '118' '4' bul'869'ks. The '290', a loud splash announced '7' my brave Queequeg '97' dived to '4' rescue. One packed rush '28' '721'e to '4' '500', '6' e'131' '784' '893'ed e'131' ripple, as mo'508't '858'ed mo'508't, '6' no '659' of ei'4'r '4' sinker or '4' diver '87' be '333'. Some '524' '56' jumped '155' a boat '549''500', '6' pu'50'd a '105' '141' '83' '4' ship.
"Ha! ha!" cried Daggoo, '34' at '336', '83' '90' '56' '935', s'768'ging perch '118''342'; '6' '262' fur'4'r '141' '83' '4' '500', we '282' an arm thrust up'40' '83' '4' blue waves; a sight st'868'ge to '66', as an arm thrust '17'th '83' '4' gr'652' '118' a grave.
"Both! '312'!—it is '312'!"—cried Daggoo '158' '31' a joyful sh'44'; '6' '358' '180', Queequeg '28' '333' b'261'ly striking '44' '31' '63' h'6', '6' '31' '4' '173' clutching '4' '192' h'769' of '4' Indian. Drawn '155' '4' '483' boat, '69' '85' quickly '561' to '4' deck; '33' Tashtego '28' '192' in '260' to, '6' Queequeg '64' '23' '73' '131' brisk.
Now, '60' '97' '14' noble rescue '91' accompli'50'd? Why, diving '180' '4' slowly desc'398'ing '342', Queequeg '31' '90' keen s'429' '97' '721'e '500' lunges '958' '716' bottom, so as to s'537'tle a large hole t'43'; '98' '705'ping '90' s'429', '97' thrust '90' '192' arm '458' in'869'ds '6' up'869'ds, '6' so hauled '44' '719' Tash by '4' '342'. He aver'796', '7' upon '171' thrusting in '17' '58', a leg '28' '986'ed; '33' '35' kno'768'g '7' '7' '28' '23' as it ought to be, '6' '240' occasion '164' '461';—he '97' thrust '78' '4' leg, '6' by a dexterous heave '6' toss, '97' wrought a '96'r'451' upon '4' Indian; so '7' '31' '4' '290' trial, he '246' '17'th in '4' '68' '261' '103'—'342' '17'e'344'. As '17' '4' '164' '342' '716'elf, '7' '28' '143' as '35' as '87' be '741'ed.
And thus, '209' '4' c'119'age '6' '164' s'320' in obstetrics of Queequeg, '4' de'349''868'ce, or '743', deli'131' of Tashtego, '28' success'597'y accompli'50'd, in '4' teeth, '111', of '4' '344' unto'869'd '6' app'36'ntly '274''759' impedi'508'ts; '265' is a '759'on by no '410' to be '17''61''606'. Mid'362'ry '134' be taught in '4' '276' '239' '31' fencing '6' '990'ing, riding '6' ro'768'g.
I k'56' '7' '14' queer adventure of '4' Gay-Header's '76' be '115' to '562' inc'796'ible to '96' l'6's'508', '463' '69' '116'selves '289' '19' ei'4'r '333' or '299' of '96' '63''s f'34'ing '155' a cistern ashore; an '829' '265' '23' seldom '308's, '6' '31' '137' '759' '385' '111' '169' '4' Indian's, con'500''847' '4' exceeding slipperiness of '4' curb of '4' Sperm Whale's '35'.
But, peradventure, it '289' be sagaciously urged, '60' is '14'? We '147' '4' tissued, infiltrated '342' of '4' Sperm Whale, '28' '4' '703'est '6' '344' corky '348' '39' '58'; '6' '332' thou '408't it sink in an ele'508't of a '458' '164'er specific gravity '169' '716'elf. We '19' '4'e t'43'. Not at '34', '33' I '19' ye; '17' at '4' '75' '719' Tash '947' in, '4' '390' '97' '91' '958'ly emptied of '716' '703'er con'606'ts, '568' '105' '33' '4' dense '606'dinous w'34' of '4' '35'—a double welded, hamme'796' substance, as I '19' '165' '136', '137' heavier '169' '4' sea '604', '6' a lump of '265' sinks in it '46' lead al'344'.

Now, '97' Tashtego peri'50'd in '7' '342', it '97' '91' a '131' precious perishing; smot'43'd in '4' '131' '691'st '6' daintiest of frag'868't spermaceti; c'141'ined, '230'sed, '6' tom'515' in '4' '669' inner chamber '6' sanctum sanctorum of '4' whale.

CHAPTER 79. The Pr'769'ie.

To s'51' '4' '518's of '90' '352', or '174' '4' bumps on '4' '342' of '14' Levia'169'; '14' is a '124' '265' no Physiognomist or Phrenologist '129' as '332' '447''645'. Such an enterprise '72' '562' al'344' as '274'ful as '17' Lavater to '19' scrutinized '4' wrinkles on '4' Rock of Gibraltar, or '17' G'34' to '19' mounted a ladder '6' '128'ipu'399'd '4' Dome of '4' Pan'4'on. S'773', in '7' famous '176' of '90', Lavater '23' '146' tr'545's of '4' various '352's of '508', '33' '516' at'606'tively stu'474's '4' '352's of horses, birds, serpents, '6' fish; '6' d'35's in detail upon '4' modifications of expression discernible t'43'in. Nor '19' G'34' '6' '90' disciple Spurzheim failed to '687' '44' '96' hints '678'ing '4' phrenological char'735'eristics of '173' '213's '169' '128'. T'43''17'e, '463' I am '33' ill qualified '17' a pi'63'er, in '4' application of '182' '149' semi-sciences to '4' whale, I '76' do my '398'eavor. I '244' '34' '124's; I achieve '11' I '51'.
Physiognomic'34'y regarded, '4' Sperm Whale is an anomalous cr'545'ure. He '129' no proper nose. And '317' '4' nose is '4' central '6' '344' conspicuous of '4' f'545'ures; '6' '317' it '760' '344' modifies '6' fin'34'y '632's '238' combined expression; hence it '72' '562' '7' '716' '797' absence, as an external app'398'age, '259' '131' largely affect '4' coun'606'ance of '4' whale. For as in l'6'scape gardening, a spire, cupola, monu'508't, or t'969'r of '96' '563', is deemed al'344' indispens'473' to '4' comp'123'ion of '4' scene; so no '352' '51' be physiognomic'34'y in '184'ing '327' '4' elevated '422'-'176' belfry of '4' nose. Dash '4' nose '83' Phidias's marble Jove, '6' '11' a '120' remainder! N'167''4''759', Levia'169' is of so '240'y a magnitude, '34' '90' proportions '36' so '892'ly, '7' '4' '276' deficiency '265' in '4' sculptu'796' Jove '85' hideous, in '58' is no blemish at '34'. Nay, it is an added gr'6'eur. A nose to '4' whale '72' '19' '91' impertinent. As on y'119' physiognomical voyage '1' sail round '90' vast '342' in y'119' jolly-boat, y'119' noble c'336'ptions of '58' '36' n'167' insulted by '4' reflection '7' he '129' a nose to be '732'ed. A pestilent c'336'it, '265' so of'606' '76' insist upon obtruding '140' '74' be'956' '4' '240'iest royal beadle on '90' thr'63'.
In '96' '348'iculars, '760' '4' '344' imposing physiognomical view to be '97' of '4' Sperm Whale, is '7' of '4' '597' '569' of '90' '342'. T'90' aspect is sublime.
In '147', a '178' hu'128' brow is '46' '4' East '74' '461'd '31' '4' '339'. In '4' repose of '4' '536'ure, '4' curled brow of '4' bull '129' a '678' of '4' gr'6' in it. Pushing heavy '51'non up mountain defiles, '4' elephant's brow is majestic. Hu'128' or animal, '4' mystical brow is as '7' '164' g'261'en seal af'950'ed by '4' Ger'128' Emperors to '238' decrees. It '659'ifies—"God: d'63' '14' '183' by my h'6'." But in '344' cr'545'ures, nay in '128' '58''968', '131' of'606' '4' brow is '33' a mere s'798' of alpine l'6' '666' '549' '4' s'56' '518'. Few '36' '4' '17'e'342's '265' '46' Shakespe'36''s or Melancthon's rise so '530', '6' desc'398' so low, '7' '4' '495' '116'selves '562' '574', eternal, tide'759' mountain lakes; '6' '34' above '116' in '4' '17'e'342''s wrinkles, '1' '562' to track '4' antle'796' '147's desc'398'ing t'43' to '580', as '4' Highl'6' hunters track '4' s'56' prints of '4' deer. But in '4' '164' Sperm Whale, '14' '530' '6' '240'y '152'-'46' dignity in'43'nt in '4' brow is so im'508'sely amplified, '7' gazing on it, in '7' '597' '569' view, '1' '174' '4' Deity '6' '4' d'504' '637's '117' '17'cibly '169' in be'956' '138' '173' object in '565' nature. For '1' '66' no '63' '378' precisely; '23' '63' distinct f'545'ure is revealed; no nose, '495', ears, or '843'; no '352'; he '129' '697', proper; no'124' '33' '7' '63' b'937' firma'508't of a '17'e'342', pl'545'ed '31' riddles; dumbly l'969''847' '31' '4' doom of boats, '6' ships, '6' '508'. Nor, in profile, '185' '14' wondrous brow diminish; '463' '7' '103' viewed '716' gr'6'eur '185' '23' do'462'er upon '1' so. In profile, '1' plainly perceive '7' horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in '4' '17'e'342''s '845', '265', in '128', is Lavater's mark of genius.
But '60'? Genius in '4' Sperm Whale? Has '4' Sperm Whale '167' writ'606' a '560', spoken a speech? No, '90' '164' genius is decla'796' in '90' '143' no'124' '348'icular to '831' it. It is '117''118' decla'796' in '90' pyramidical silence. And '14' re'241's me '7' '97' '4' '164' Sperm Whale '91' '677' to '4' '507' Orient World, he '72' '19' '91' deified by '238' '497'-magian '147's. T'84' deified '4' crocodile of '4' Nile, beca'364' '4' crocodile is tongue'759'; '6' '4' Sperm Whale '129' no tongue, or at '402' it is so exceedingly sm'34', as to be incap'473' of protrusion. If '43''180' '138' '530'ly cultu'796', poetical nation sh'34' lure '78' to '238' birth-'40', '4' merry May-'183' '152's of '261'; '6' '565'ly enthr'63' '116' '158' in '4' '56' e'61'istical sky; in '4' '56' unh'976'ed hill; '98' be '115', exalted to Jove's '530' s'545', '4' '164' Sperm Whale sh'34' lord it.
Champollion decip'43'd '4' wrinkled g'868'ite hieroglyphics. But t'43' is no Champollion to decip'49' '4' Egypt of e'131' '128''s '6' e'131' '213''s '352'. Physiognomy, '46' e'131' '173' hu'128' science, is '33' a '962'ing f'473'. If '98', Sir William J'913', '94' '504' in thirty languages, '87' '23' '504' '4' '910'st peasant's '352' in '716' profo'447' '6' '117' subtle '80'ings, '60' '289' un'123'te'796' Ishmael '274' to '504' '4' awful Chaldee of '4' Sperm Whale's brow? I '33' '186' '7' brow '165' '1'. Read it if '1' '51'.




CHAPTER 80. The Nut.

If '4' Sperm Whale be physiognomic'34'y a Sphinx, to '4' phrenologist '90' brain '562's '7' geo'559'rical circle '265' it is im'622' to squ'36'.
In '4' '597'-gr'249' cr'545'ure '4' skull '76' mea'115' at '402' t'277'y '908' in length. Unhinge '4' l'969'r jaw, '6' '4' '500' view of '14' skull is as '4' '500' of a moderately inc'518'd '519'e '426'ing '209''44' on a level base. But in '139'—as we '19' '234'w'43' '333'—'14' inc'518'd '519'e is angularly filled up, '6' al'344' squa'796' by '4' enormous superincumbent m'652' of '4' junk '6' sperm. At '4' '530' '398' '4' skull '17'ms a crater to '515' '7' '348' of '4' m'652'; '313' '447' '4' '192' '983' of '14' crater—in an'173' cavity seldom exceeding '606' inches in length '6' as '128'y in depth—reposes '4' mere h'6'ful of '14' monster's brain. The brain is at '402' t'277'y '908' '83' '90' app'36'nt '17'e'342' in '139'; it is hidden '170' '528' '716' vast ou'149'rks, '46' '4' inner'344' citadel '31'in '4' amplified '17'tifications of Quebec. So '46' a '667' c'257'et is it '669'ed in '58', '7' I '19' '677' '96' whale'508' '94' peremptorily deny '7' '4' Sperm Whale '129' '138' '173' brain '169' '7' palp'473' semblance of '63' '17'med by '4' cubic-yards of '90' sperm magazine. Lying in st'868'ge f'261's, '239's, '6' convolutions, to '238' apprehensions, it '562's '117' in '184'ing '31' '4' '256' of '90' general '240' to regard '7' mystic '348' of '58' as '4' s'545' of '90' in'81'igence.
It is plain, '98', '7' phrenologic'34'y '4' '342' of '14' Levia'169', in '4' cr'545'ure's '565' int'735' '892', is an '797' delusion. As '17' '90' '354' brain, '1' '51' '98' '66' no indications of it, nor '174' '138'. The whale, '46' '34' '124's '7' '36' '240'y, '854's a false brow to '4' common '296'.
If '1' unload '90' skull of '716' spermy heaps '6' '98' '101' a rear view of '716' rear '398', '265' is '4' '530' '398', '1' '76' be struck by '716' resemblance to '4' hu'128' skull, beheld in '4' '276' '421'uation, '6' '83' '4' '276' '378' of view. Indeed, '226' '14' r'167'sed skull (scaled d'249' to '4' hu'128' magnitude) among a p'399' of '508''s skulls, '6' '1' '72' involuntarily con'295' it '31' '116'; '6' remarking '4' depressions on '63' '348' of '716' summit, in phrenological phrase '1' '72' '99'—T'90' '128' '97' no '968'-esteem, '6' no veneration. And by '200' negations, con'500''796' '549' '31' '4' affirmative '418' of '90' prodigious bulk '6' '637', '1' '51' '258' '17'm to y'119''968' '4' '354'st, '463' '23' '4' '344' exhilarating c'336'ption of '11' '4' '344' exalted po'606'cy is.
But if '83' '4' comparative di'508'sions of '4' whale's proper brain, '1' deem it incap'473' of '213' adequately charted, '98' I '19' an'173' '256' '17' '1'. If '1' at'606'tively regard al'344' '138' quadruped's spine, '1' '76' be struck '31' '4' resemblance of '716' vertebrae to a st'366'g necklace of d'869'fed skulls, '34' bea'847' rudi'508'tal resemblance to '4' skull proper. It is a Ger'128' c'336'it, '7' '4' vertebrae '36' '581' undeveloped skulls. But '4' curious external resemblance, I '101' it '4' Ger'128's '85' '23' '4' '171' '508' to perceive. A '17'eign fri'398' '336' '378'ed it '44' to me, in '4' ske'123'on of a foe he '97' slain, '6' '31' '4' vertebrae of '265' he '28' inlaying, in a '563' of b'652'o-re'596'vo, '4' beaked prow of '90' '51'oe. Now, I con'500'r '7' '4' phrenologists '19' omitted an '425' '124' in '23' pushing '238' investigations '83' '4' cerebellum '209' '4' spinal '51'al. For I '172' '7' '137' of a '128''s char'735'er '76' be '295' '592'okened in '90' '78'b'63'. I '72' '743' '174' y'119' spine '169' y'119' skull, '94''167' '1' '36'. A thin joist of a spine n'167' '332' upheld a '597' '6' noble soul. I rejo'972' in my spine, as in '4' firm audacious staff of '7' flag '265' I fling '499' '44' to '4' '296'.
Apply '14' spinal b'868'ch of phrenology to '4' Sperm Whale. His c'868'ial cavity is continuous '31' '4' '171' neck-vertebra; '6' in '7' vertebra '4' bottom of '4' spinal '51'al '76' mea'115' '606' inches across, '213' '879' in h'879', '6' of a triangular '575' '31' '4' base d'249''869'ds. As it '962'es '209' '4' remaining vertebrae '4' '51'al '890'rs in size, '33' '17' a con'500'r'473' distance remains of large capa'709'. Now, of '239', '14' '51'al is filled '31' '137' '4' '276' st'868'gely fibrous substance—'4' spinal cord—as '4' brain; '6' directly communicates '31' '4' brain. And '11' is s'773' '117', '17' '128'y '908' '180' emerging '83' '4' brain's cavity, '4' spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, al'344' equal to '7' of '4' brain. Under '34' '182' circumstances, '72' it be un'385''473' to survey '6' map '44' '4' whale's spine phrenologic'34'y? For, viewed in '14' '703', '4' '533' comparative sm'34'ness of '90' brain proper is '117' '169' compensated by '4' '533' comparative magnitude of '90' spinal cord.
But '568' '14' hint to operate as it '289' '31' '4' phrenologists, I '72' merely '652'ume '4' spinal '4'ory '17' a mo'508't, in reference to '4' Sperm Whale's hump. T'90' august hump, if I mis'101' '23', rises '118' '63' of '4' larger vertebrae, '6' is, t'43''17'e, in '96' '563', '4' '44'er convex mould of it. From '716' relative '421'uation '98', I '134' c'34' '14' '530' hump '4' organ of firmness or indomit'473'ness in '4' Sperm Whale. And '7' '4' '164' monster is indomit'473', '1' '76' '332' '19' '385' to k'56'.




CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.

The p'796'estinated '183' arrived, '6' we duly '559' '4' ship Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bre'508'.
At '63' '75' '4' '164'est whaling '151' in '4' '296', '4' Dutch '6' Ger'128's '36' '56' among '4' '402'; '33' '43' '6' t'43' at '131' wide intervals of latitude '6' '192'itude, '1' s'773' occasion'34'y '381' '31' '238' flag in '4' Pacific.
For '96' '385', '4' Jungfrau '562'ed '538' eager to '490' '49' '952's. While '332' '96' distance '83' '4' Pequod, '50' rounded to, '6' '705'ping a boat, '49' captain '28' impelled to'869'ds us, impatiently st'6'ing in '4' bows '861' of '4' stern.
"What '129' he in '90' h'6' t'43'?" cried Starbuck, '378'ing to so'559'hing wavingly held by '4' Ger'128'. "Im'622'!—a lamp-feeder!"
"Not '7'," '136' Stubb, "no, no, '30' a c'141'ee-pot, '197' Starbuck; '86' '260' '141' to '106' us '119' c'141'ee, is '4' Yar'128'; '21' '1' '66' '7' '201' tin '51' t'43' '549''500' of '58'?—'55' '90' boiling '604'. Oh! '86' '34' '40', is '4' Yar'128'."
"Go '549' '31' '1'," cried Fl'257', "'30' a lamp-feeder '6' an oil-'51'. He's '44' of oil, '6' '129' '67' a-begging."
How'167' curious it '289' '562' '17' an oil-ship to be borro'768'g oil on '4' whale-ground, '6' '60''167' '137' it '289' invertedly contradict '4' '261' '831'rb '39' '324'rying coals to Newcastle, '332' so'559'imes '375' a '124' re'34'y '308's; '6' in '4' '986' '390' Captain Derick De Deer '64' indu'437'ably conduct a lamp-feeder as Fl'257' '64' decl'36'.
As he mounted '4' deck, Ahab abruptly accosted '58', '327' at '34' heeding '11' he '97' in '90' h'6'; '33' in '90' '785'n lingo, '4' Ger'128' '358' evinced '90' comp'123'e igno'868'ce of '4' W'479'e Whale; immediately '391'ing '4' conversation to '90' lamp-feeder '6' oil '51', '31' '96' remarks '678'ing '90' '305' to '391' '155' '90' hammock at '168' in pro'295' '967'ness—'90' '181' '705' of Bre'508' oil '213' g'63', '6' '23' a single f'666'-fish '332' captu'796' to supply '4' deficiency; concluding by hinting '7' '90' ship '28' indeed '11' in '4' Fi'50'ry is technic'34'y c'34'ed a '817' '63' ('7' is, an empty '63'), '35' deserving '4' '275' of Jungfrau or '4' Virgin.
His neces'421'ies supp'596'd, Derick de'348'ed; '33' he '97' '23' gained '90' ship's '500', '74' whales '85' al'344' simultaneously raised '83' '4' mast-'342's of '312' vessels; '6' so eager '17' '4' c'129'e '28' Derick, '7' '327' pa'970' to '186' '90' oil-'51' '6' lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round '90' boat '6' '721'e '180' '4' levia'169' lamp-feeders.
Now, '4' '544' '305' risen to lee'869'd, he '6' '4' '173' '291' Ger'128' boats '7' '358' '858'ed '58', '97' con'500'rably '4' '319' of '4' Pequod's keels. T'43' '85' '879' whales, an average pod. Aw'36' of '238' danger, '69' '85' '45' '34' abreast '31' '164' speed '688' '165' '4' '768'd, rubbing '238' flanks as '452'ly as so '128'y spans of horses in harness. T'84' '269' a '164', wide '830', as '463' continu'34'y unrolling a '164' wide parch'508't upon '4' sea.
Full in '14' rapid '830', '6' '128'y fathoms in '4' rear, swam a huge, humped '261' bull, '265' by '90' comparatively slow progress, as '35' as by '4' unusual yello'392' incrustations '118'gro'768'g '58', '562'ed afflicted '31' '4' jaund'972', or '96' '173' infirmity. Whe'4'r '14' whale be'192'ed to '4' pod in advance, '562'ed '455''473'; '17' it is '23' customary '17' '375' vener'473' levia'169's to be at '34' social. N'167''4''759', he stuck to '238' '830', '463' indeed '238' '78' '604' '259' '19' retarded '58', beca'364' '4' '691'-b'63' or s'35' at '90' b'937' muzzle '28' a da'50'd '63', '46' '4' s'35' '17'med '74' '149' hostile currents '381'.

"Who's '61' '96' p'36'goric?" '136' Stubb, "he '129' '4' stomach-ache, '16' '423'. Lord, '54' of '305' '499' an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse '768'ds '36' '956' '721' '617' in '58', '311's. It's '4' '171' foul '768'd I '167' k'212' to blow '83' astern; '33' '73', '64' '167' whale yaw so '165'? it '259' be, '86' '387' '90' '773'er."
As an '118'laden India'128' bea'847' d'249' '4' Hindostan coast '31' a deck load of frigh'606'ed horses, '324'eens, buries, rolls, '6' w'34'ows on '49' '103'; so '64' '14' '261' whale heave '90' aged bulk, '6' '56' '6' '98' '348'ly '391'ing '118' on '90' cumbrous rib-'398's, expose '4' ca'364' of '90' devious '830' in '4' unnatural stump of '90' starboard fin. Whe'4'r he '97' '387' '7' fin in battle, or '97' '91' born '327' it, it '85' '321' to '99'.
"Only '154' a '437', '261' chap, '6' '82' '145' ye a sling '17' '7' wounded arm," cried cruel Fl'257', '378'ing to '4' whale-'518' '958' '58'.
"Mind he '21' sling '4'e '31' it," cried Starbuck. "Give '103', or '4' Ger'128' '76' '19' '58'."
With '63' in'606't '34' '4' combined rival boats '85' '378'ed '17' '14' '63' fish, beca'364' '23' '146' '28' he '4' largest, '6' t'43''17'e '4' '344' valu'473' whale, '33' he '28' '958'est to '116', '6' '4' '173' whales '85' '45' '31' '375' '164' velo'709', '117''118', as al'344' to defy pursuit '17' '4' '75'. At '14' juncture '4' Pequod's keels '97' s'576' by '4' '291' Ger'128' boats '181' l'969''796'; '33' '83' '4' '164' '319' he '97' '97', Derick's boat s'773' led '4' c'129'e, '463' e'131' mo'508't nea'796' by '90' '17'eign rivals. The '146' '124' '69' fea'796', '28', '7' '83' '213' '287' so nigh to '90' mark, he '72' be en'473'd to dart '90' iron '165' '69' '87' comp'123'ely '118''101' '6' '962' '58'. As '17' Derick, he '562'ed '538' confident '7' '14' '72' be '4' '390', '6' occasion'34'y '31' a deriding gesture shook '90' lamp-feeder at '4' '173' boats.
"The ungracious '6' ungrateful '766'!" cried Starbuck; "he mocks '6' d'36's me '31' '4' '131' '719'-'990' I filled '17' '58' '23' '401' '294's '414'!"—'98' in '90' '261' in'606'se w'90'per—"Give '103', greyhounds! Dog to it!"
"I '81' ye '11' it is, '508'"—cried Stubb to '90' crew—"'30' '485' my religion to '42' '721'; '33' '190' '46' to '545' '7' villainous Yar'128'—Pull—'205' ye? Are ye '45' to '123' '7' rascal '942' ye? Do ye '112' br'6'y? A hog'50'ad of br'6'y, '98', to '4' '258' '128'. Come, '65' '21' '96' of ye burst a '593'-vessel? Who's '7' '91' '705'ping an anchor '118'board—we '21' budge an inch—'110' be'804'ed. H'34'oo, '43''s gr'652' gro'768'g in '4' boat's bottom—'6' by '4' Lord, '4' mast t'43''s budding.

"Oh! '66' '4' suds he '408'!" cried Fl'257', dancing up '6' d'249'—"What a hump—Oh, do pile on '4' beef—lays '46' a log! Oh! my lads, do sp'847'—slap-jacks '6' quahogs '17' supper, '1' k'56', my lads—baked clams '6' muffins—oh, do, do, sp'847',—'86' a hund'796' '960'reller—'21' '521' '58' '56'—'21' oh, '21'!—'66' '7' Yar'128'—Oh, '205' ye '732' '17' y'119' duff, my lads—'375' a sog!

At '14' mo'508't Derick '28' in '4' '735' of pitching '90' lamp-feeder at '4' advancing boats, '6' '516' '90' oil-'51'; '760' '31' '4' double view of retarding '90' rivals' '103', '6' at '4' '276' '75' economic'34'y accelerating '90' '249' by '4' mo'508'tary impetus of '4' '78''869'd toss.
"The un'128'nerly Dutch '766'ger!" cried Stubb. "Pull '56', '508', '46' fifty thous'6' '518'-of-battle-ship loads of '796'-hai'796' d'779's. What d'ye '99', Tashtego; '36' '1' '4' '128' to snap y'119' spine in '149'-'6'-t'277'y '747's '17' '4' hon'119' of '261' Gay'342'? What d'ye '99'?"
"I '99', '732' '46' '152'-dam,"—cried '4' Indian.
Fiercely, '33' '140'ly incited by '4' t'976's of '4' Ger'128', '4' Pequod's '291' boats '56' began '868'ging al'344' abreast; '6', so disposed, mo'508'tarily nea'796' '58'. In '7' '178', loose, chivalrous attitude of '4' '342's'128' '74' dra'768'g '958' to '90' prey, '4' '291' mates s'111'd up '896'ly, occasion'34'y '78'ing '4' '180' oars'128' '31' an exhilarating cry of, "T'43' '50' slides, '56'! Hurrah '17' '4' '691'-ash breeze! D'249' '31' '4' Yar'128'! Sail '118' '58'!"
But so '750' an original '319' '97' Derick '97', '7' spite of '34' '238' g'34'an'244', he '72' '19' '831'd '4' victor in '14' race, '97' '23' a '40'eous judg'508't desc'398'ed upon '58' in a crab '265' '808' '4' blade of '90' midship oars'128'. While '14' clumsy lubber '28' striving to '523' '90' '691'-ash, '6' '313', in consequence, Derick's boat '28' nigh to capsizing, '6' he th'447'ing '170' at '90' '508' in a '240'y rage;—'7' '28' a '68' '75' '17' Starbuck, Stubb, '6' Fl'257'. With a sh'44', '69' '111'k a mortal '319' '17''869'ds, '6' slantingly '868'ged up on '4' Ger'128''s quarter. An instant '117', '6' '34' '492' boats '85' di'414'nic'34'y in '4' whale's immediate '830', '313' stretching '83' '116', on '312' '500's, '28' '4' foaming s'35' '7' he '721'e.
It '28' a terrific, '344' piti'473', '6' '721'dening sight. The whale '28' '56' '45' '342' '44', '6' '642'ing '90' sp'44' '165' '58' in a continual tor'508'ted jet; '313' '90' '63' '719' fin '942' '90' '500' in an '414'ny of f'40'. Now to '14' h'6', '56' to '7', he yawed in '90' falte'847' f'703', '6' s'773' at e'131' '899'ow '7' he '785', he spasmodic'34'y sank in '4' sea, or '500''103's rolled to'869'ds '4' sky '90' '63' '942'ing fin. So '19' I '333' a bird '31' clipped '768'g '380' aff'40'ed '785'n circles in '4' '769', vainly striving to escape '4' piratical hawks. But '4' bird '129' a '915', '6' '31' plaintive cries '76' '106' '677' '49' fear; '33' '4' fear of '14' vast dumb brute of '4' sea, '28' chained up '6' enchanted in '58'; he '97' no '915', '550' '7' choking respiration '209' '90' spiracle, '6' '14' '721'e '4' sight of '58' un'613'ably piti'473'; '313' s'773', in '90' '738' bulk, portcullis jaw, '6' omnipo'606't tail, t'43' '28' '243' to appal '4' stou'704' '128' '94' so pitied.
Seeing '56' '7' '33' a '131' '360' mo'508'ts '117' '72' '145' '4' Pequod's boats '4' advantage, '6' '743' '169' be thus foiled of '90' '544', Derick chose to hazard '11' to '58' '259' '19' '562'ed a '344' unusu'34'y '192' dart, ere '4' '181' '365' '72' '17' '167' escape.
But no '358'er '64' '90' harpo'63'er st'6' up '17' '4' stroke, '169' '34' '291' tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sp'868'g to '238' '908', '6' st'6'ing in a di'414'nal row, simultaneously '378'ed '238' '960'bs; '6' darted '118' '4' '342' of '4' Ger'128' harpo'63'er, '238' '291' Nantucket irons ente'796' '4' whale. Blinding vap'119's of foam '6' '691'-'522'! The '291' boats, in '4' '171' fury of '4' whale's '342''192' rush, bumped '4' Ger'128''s a'500' '31' '375' '17'ce, '7' '312' Derick '6' '90' baffled harpo'63'er '85' spilled '44', '6' sailed '118' by '4' '291' f'666' keels.
"Don't be '423', my '33'ter-'990'es," cried Stubb, casting a '962'ing glance upon '116' as he s'576' by; "ye'll be '512'ed up '986'ly—'34' '40'—I '282' '96' sharks astern—St. Bernard's '766's, '1' k'56'—re'596've distressed travellers. Hurrah! '14' is '4' '103' to sail '56'. E'131' keel a sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go '46' '291' tin kettles at '4' tail of a '721' cougar! T'90' '186's me in '241' of fas'606'ing to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain—'408' '4' wheel-spokes fly, '311's, '74' '1' fas'606' to '58' '7' '103'; '6' t'43''s danger of '213' pitched '44' '111', '74' '1' strike a hill. Hurrah! '14' is '4' '103' a '947'ow '174's '74' '86' '45' to Davy J'913'—'34' a rush d'249' an '398''759' inc'518'd '519'e! Hurrah! '14' whale '324'ries '4' '167''181'ing mail!"
But '4' monster's '366' '28' a brief '63'. Giving a sudden gasp, he tumultuously '602'ed. With a grating rush, '4' '291' '518's flew round '4' logger'342's '31' '375' a '17'ce as to gouge deep grooves in '116'; '313' so fearful '85' '4' harpo'63'ers '7' '14' rapid '602'ing '72' '358' exhaust '4' '518's, '7' '970' '34' '238' dexterous '240', '69' '808' rep'545'ed smoking '391's '31' '4' rope to '330' on; '773' at '181'—o'768'g to '4' perp'398'icular strain '83' '4' lead-'518'd chocks of '4' boats, '74'ce '4' '291' ropes '277' '688' d'249' '155' '4' blue—'4' '723'wales of '4' bows '85' al'344' '140' '31' '4' '604', '313' '4' '291' sterns tilted '530' in '4' '769'. And '4' whale '358' ceasing to '602', '17' '96' '75' '69' remained in '7' attitude, fearful of exp'398'ing '117' '518', '463' '4' po'421'ion '28' a '105' ticklish. But '463' boats '19' '91' '645' d'249' '6' '387' in '14' '103', '332' it is '14' "'956' on," as it is c'34'ed; '14' hooking up by '4' sharp '960'bs of '90' '349' flesh '83' '4' '78'; '14' it is '7' of'606' tor'508'ts '4' Levia'169' '155' '358' rising '158' to '381' '4' sharp lance of '90' foes. Yet '23' to '613' of '4' peril of '4' '124', it is to be doubted whe'4'r '14' '239' is '194' '4' '258'; '17' it is '33' '385''473' to presume, '7' '4' '192'er '4' stricken whale '235's '447' '604', '4' '117' he is exhausted. Beca'364', o'768'g to '4' enormous sur'352' of '58'—in a '597' gr'249' sperm whale so'559'hing '759' '169' 2000 squ'36' '908'—'4' pres'115' of '4' '604' is im'508'se. We '34' k'56' '11' an astonishing atmosp'49'ic w'879' we '119'selves st'6' up '447'; '140' '43', above-ground, in '4' '769'; '60' vast, '98', '4' burden of a whale, bea'847' on '90' '78' a column of '149' hund'796' fathoms of ocean! It '259' at '402' equal '4' w'879' of fifty atmosp'43's. One whale'128' '129' estimated it at '4' w'879' of t'277'y '518'-of-battle ships, '31' '34' '238' '723's, '6' stores, '6' '508' on board.
As '4' '291' boats lay t'43' on '7' gently rolling sea, gazing d'249' '155' '716' eternal blue noon; '6' as '23' a single groan or cry of '138' '563', nay, '23' so '137' as a ripple or a bubble '246' up '83' '716' depths; '11' l'6's'128' '72' '19' '147', '7' ben'545'h '34' '7' silence '6' placidity, '4' ut'344' monster of '4' seas '28' wri'124' '6' wrenching in '414'ny! Not '879' inches of perp'398'icular rope '85' visible at '4' bows.

Is '14' '4' cr'545'ure of '94'm it '28' '336' so triumphantly '136'—"Canst thou fill '90' skin '31' '960''515' irons? or '90' '342' '31' fish-spears?

T'90' '4' cr'545'ure? '14' he? Oh! '7' unfulfil'508'ts '134' '858' '4' prophets. For '31' '4' strength of a thous'6' t'530's in '90' tail, Levia'169' '97' '366' '90' '342' '447' '4' mountains of '4' sea, to hide '58' '83' '4' Pequod's fish-spears!
In '7' sloping '180'noon sun'703', '4' s'97'ows '7' '4' '291' boats '708' d'249' ben'545'h '4' sur'352', '259' '19' '91' '192' '243' '6' b'937' '243' to s'97'e '499' Xerxes' army. Who '51' '81' '60' app'34'ing to '4' wounded whale '259' '19' '91' '375' huge phantoms flitting '118' '90' '342'!
"St'6' by, '508'; he stirs," cried Starbuck, as '4' '291' '518's suddenly vibrated in '4' '604', distinctly conducting up'869'ds to '116', as by magnetic wires, '4' '139' '6' '548' throbs of '4' whale, so '7' e'131' oars'128' '577' '116' in '90' s'545'. The '290' mo'508't, re'596'ved in '164' '348' '83' '4' d'249''869'd strain at '4' bows, '4' boats '417' a sudden bounce up'869'ds, as a sm'34' '972'field '76', '74' a dense '49'd of '691' bears '36' s'324'ed '83' it '155' '4' sea.
"Haul in! Haul in!" cried Starbuck '158'; "'86' rising."
The '518's, of '265', '321'ly an instant '165', '23' '63' h'6''s b'504'th '87' '19' '91' gained, '85' '56' in '192' quick coils flung '78' '34' dripping '155' '4' boats, '6' '358' '4' whale '785' '604' '31'in '149' ship's lengths of '4' hunters.
His motions plainly de'23'ed '90' extreme exhaustion. In '344' l'6' animals t'43' '36' '979' valves or flood-gates in '128'y of '238' veins, w'43'by '74' wounded, '4' '593' is in '96' degree at '402' instantly '472' '141' in '979' directions. Not so '31' '4' whale; '63' of '94'se peculiarities it is to '19' an '797' non-valvular structure of '4' '593'-vessels, so '7' '74' pierced '140' by so sm'34' a '378' as a harpoon, a '314'ly drain is at '336' be'723' upon '90' '251' arterial system; '6' '74' '14' is heigh'606'ed by '4' extraordinary pres'115' of '604' at a '164' distance below '4' sur'352', '90' '139' '289' be '136' to p'119' '83' '58' in incessant streams. Yet so vast is '4' quantity of '593' in '58', '6' so distant '6' numerous '716' interior fountains, '7' he '76' '184' thus bleeding '6' bleeding '17' a con'500'r'473' period; '140' as in a drought a river '76' flow, '94'se s'119'ce is in '4' '35'-sp'847's of '458'-'141' '6' undiscernible hills. '938'n '56', '74' '4' boats '732'ed upon '14' whale, '6' perilously drew '118' '90' s'103'ing flukes, '6' '4' lances '85' darted '155' '58', '69' '85' '858'ed by steady jets '83' '4' '212' '721'e wound, '265' '764' continu'34'y '657', '313' '4' natural sp'44'-hole in '90' '342' '28' '146' at intervals, '60''167' rapid, '642'ing '716' aff'40'ed moisture '155' '4' '769'. From '14' '181' vent no '593' '332' '246', beca'364' no vital '348' of '58' '97' thus '458' '91' struck. His '139', as '69' '659'ifi'51'tly c'34' it, '28' un'678'ed.
As '4' boats '56' '117' '452'ly surrounded '58', '4' '251' upper '348' of '90' '17'm, '31' '137' of it '7' is ordinarily submerged, '28' plainly revealed. His '495', or '743' '4' '226's w'43' '90' '495' '97' '91', '85' beheld. As st'868'ge misgr'249' m'652'es ga'4'r in '4' k'23'-holes of '4' noblest oaks '74' prostrate, so '83' '4' '378's '265' '4' whale's '495' '97' '336' occupied, '56' protruded blind bulbs, horribly piti'473' to '66'. But pity t'43' '28' '697'. For '34' '90' '261' age, '6' '90' '63' arm, '6' '90' blind '495', he '259' '474' '4' '548' '6' be murde'796', in '619' to '703' '4' gay bridals '6' '173' merry-'380's of '508', '6' '516' to illuminate '4' solemn churches '7' pr'356' unconditional in'141'ensiveness by '34' to '34'. S'773' rolling in '90' '593', at '181' he '348'i'34'y dis'452'd a st'868'gely discol'119'ed bunch or protube'868'ce, '4' size of a bu'50'l, low d'249' on '4' flank.
"A n'972' spot," cried Fl'257'; "'22' '123' me prick '58' t'43' '336'."
"Avast!" cried Starbuck, "t'43''s no '107' of '7'!"
But hu'128'e Starbuck '28' '111' '399'. At '4' instant of '4' dart an ulcerous jet s'576' '83' '14' cruel wound, '6' goaded by it '155' '117' '169' suffer'473' anguish, '4' whale '56' sp'44'ing thick '593', '31' swift fury blindly darted at '4' craft, bespatte'847' '116' '6' '238' glorying crews '34' '118' '31' s'60'ers of gore, capsizing Fl'257''s boat '6' mar'847' '4' bows. It '28' '90' '548' stroke. For, by '14' '75', so '953' '28' he by loss of '593', '7' he '148''759'ly rolled '170' '83' '4' wreck he '97' '721'e; lay panting on '90' '500', impo'606'tly flapped '31' '90' stumped fin, '98' '118' '6' '118' slowly revolved '46' a waning '296'; '391'ed up '4' '691' '669's of '90' belly; lay '46' a log, '6' '474'd. It '28' '344' piteous, '7' '181' expi'847' sp'44'. As '74' by un'333' '524' '4' '604' is gradu'34'y drawn '141' '83' '96' '240'y fountain, '6' '31' '499'-stifled melancholy gurglings '4' spray-column l'969'rs '6' l'969'rs to '4' ground—so '4' '181' '192' dying sp'44' of '4' whale.
Soon, '313' '4' crews '85' a'483' '4' arrival of '4' ship, '4' '618' s'60'ed symptoms of sinking '31' '34' '716' trea'115's unrifled. Immediately, by Starbuck's '619's, '518's '85' secu'796' to it at '465' '378's, so '7' ere '192' e'131' boat '28' a buoy; '4' sunken whale '213' susp'398'ed a '360' inches ben'545'h '116' by '4' cords. By '131' heedful '128'age'508't, '74' '4' ship drew nigh, '4' whale '28' t'868'sfer'796' to '49' '500', '6' '28' '777'ly secu'796' t'43' by '4' stiffest fluke-chains, '17' it '28' plain '7' un'759' artifici'34'y upheld, '4' '618' '72' at '336' sink to '4' bottom.
It so '365'd '7' al'344' upon '171' '537'ting '155' '58' '31' '4' spade, '4' '797' length of a corroded harpoon '28' '295' im'515'ded in '90' flesh, on '4' l'969'r '348' of '4' bunch '165' descri'515'. But as '4' stumps of harpoons '36' frequently '295' in '4' '314' bo'474's of captu'796' whales, '31' '4' flesh '475'ly healed '187' '116', '6' no pro'462'nce of '138' '207' to de'23'e '238' '226'; t'43''17'e, t'43' '259' '460' '19' '91' '96' '173' un'677' '385' in '4' '986' '390' '597'y to ac'893' '17' '4' ulceration '34'uded to. But s'773' '117' curious '28' '4' '418' of a lance-'342' of st'63' '213' '295' in '58', '23' '458' '83' '4' buried iron, '4' flesh '475'ly firm '39' it. Who '97' darted '7' st'63' lance? And '74'? It '240' '19' '91' darted by '96' Nor' West Indian '192' '165' America '28' disc'118'ed.
What '173' marvels '240' '19' '91' rummaged '44' of '14' monstrous cabinet t'43' is no '361'. But a sudden '188' '28' '186' to fur'4'r disc'118'ies, by '4' ship's '213' unprecedentedly dragged '118' '500''103's to '4' sea, o'768'g to '4' '618''s im'508'sely increasing '606'dency to sink. How'167', Starbuck, '94' '97' '4' '619'ing of af'807's, hung on to it to '4' '181'; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, '7' '74' at length '4' ship '72' '19' '91' capsized, if s'773' persisting in locking arms '31' '4' '618'; '98', '74' '4' com'128'd '28' '145'n to '448' '574' '83' it, '375' '28' '4' immov'473' strain upon '4' timber-'342's to '265' '4' fluke-chains '6' c'473's '85' fas'606'ed, '7' it '28' im'622' to cast '116' '141'. Mean'75' e'131''124' in '4' Pequod '28' aslant. To cross to '4' '173' '500' of '4' deck '28' '46' '459'ing up '4' steep g'473'd roof of a ho'364'. The ship groaned '6' gasped. M'138' of '4' ivory inlayings of '49' bul'869'ks '6' cabins '85' '319'ed '83' '238' '226's, by '4' unnatural dislocation. In vain '524'pikes '6' crows '85' '561' to bear upon '4' immov'473' fluke-chains, to pry '116' adrift '83' '4' timber'342's; '6' so low '97' '4' whale '56' '451'tled '7' '4' submerged '398's '87' '23' be at '34' approached, '313' e'131' mo'508't '251' tons of pondero'421'y '562'ed added to '4' sinking bulk, '6' '4' ship '562'ed on '4' '378' of '45' '118'.
"H'261' on, '330' on, '205' ye?" cried Stubb to '4' '618', "'21' be in '375' a d'779' of a '906' to sink! By th'447', '508', we '259' do so'559'hing or go '17' it. No '364' prying t'43'; avast, I '99' '31' y'119' '524'pikes, '6' '366' '63' of ye '17' a prayer '560' '6' a pen-knife, '6' '537' '4' '201' chains."
"Knife? Aye, aye," cried Queequeg, '6' seizing '4' '324'penter's heavy hatchet, he leaned '44' of a porthole, '6' steel to iron, began slashing at '4' largest fluke-chains. But a '360' strokes, '597' of sparks, '85' '145'n, '74' '4' exceeding strain effected '4' '426'. With a terrific snap, e'131' fas'606'ing '277' adrift; '4' ship '40'ed, '4' '324''390' sank.
Now, '14' occasional inevit'473' sinking of '4' recently '466' Sperm Whale is a '131' curious '124'; nor '129' '138' fi'50'r'128' '332' adequately ac'893'ed '17' it. Usu'34'y '4' '314' Sperm Whale floats '31' '164' buoyancy, '31' '716' '500' or belly con'500'rably elevated above '4' sur'352'. If '4' '146' whales '7' thus sank '85' '261', meagre, '6' '785'n-'374'ed cr'545'ures, '238' pads of lard dimini'50'd '6' '34' '238' b'913' heavy '6' rheumatic; '98' '1' '240' '31' '96' '385' '652'ert '7' '14' sinking is ca'364'd by an uncommon specific gravity in '4' fish so sinking, consequent upon '14' absence of buoyant '301' in '58'. But it is '23' so. For '507' whales, in '4' '530'est health, '6' s'35'ing '31' noble aspirations, prematurely '537' '141' in '4' '869'm flush '6' May of '139', '31' '34' '238' panting lard '39' '116'; '140' '182' brawny, buoyant '49'oes do so'559'imes sink.
Be it '136', '60''167', '7' '4' Sperm Whale is '458' '759' li'473' to '14' '829' '169' '138' '173' species. W'43' '63' of '7' '563' go d'249', t'277'y Right Whales do. T'90' difference in '4' species is no doubt im'186''473' in no sm'34' degree to '4' '164'er quantity of b'63' in '4' Right Whale; '90' Venetian blinds al'63' so'559'imes weighing '117' '169' a ton; '83' '14' incumb'868'ce '4' Sperm Whale is '94'lly '523'. But t'43' '36' instances w'43', '180' '4' lapse of '128'y '520' or s'167'al '433', '4' sunken whale '158' rises, '117' buoyant '169' in '139'. But '4' '385' of '14' is obvious. Gases '36' generated in '58'; he s'35's to a prodigious magnitude; be'67's a '563' of animal b'34'oon. A '518'-of-battle ship '87' '321'ly '184' '58' '447' '98'. In '4' Shore Whaling, on '602'ings, among '4' Bays of New Zeal'6', '74' a Right Whale '145's token of sinking, '69' fas'606' buoys to '58', '31' plenty of rope; so '7' '74' '4' '618' '129' g'63' d'249', '69' k'56' w'43' to '73' '17' it '74' it sh'34' '19' asc'398'ed '158'.
It '28' '23' '192' '180' '4' sinking of '4' '618' '7' a cry '28' '299' '83' '4' Pequod's mast-'342's, announcing '7' '4' Jungfrau '28' '158' l'969''847' '49' boats; '463' '4' '146' sp'44' in sight '28' '7' of a Fin-Back, be'192'ing to '4' species of uncaptur'473' whales, beca'364' of '716' inc'796'ible '637' of swimming. N'167''4''759', '4' Fin-Back's sp'44' is so similar to '4' Sperm Whale's, '7' by unskilful fi'50'r'508' it is of'606' mis'645' '17' it. And consequently Derick '6' '34' '90' host '85' '56' in valiant c'129'e of '14' un'958''473' brute. The Virgin crowding '34' sail, '721'e '180' '49' '492' '507' keels, '6' thus '69' '34' disappea'796' '458' to lee'869'd, s'773' in b'261', '274'ful c'129'e.
Oh! '128'y '36' '4' Fin-Backs, '6' '128'y '36' '4' Dericks, my fri'398'.

T'43' '36' '96' enterprises in '265' a '324'eful dis'619''518'ss is '4' '354' '559'hod.
The '117' I dive '155' '14' '301' of whaling, '6' push my researches up to '4' '131' sp'847'-'342' of it so '137' '4' '117' am I impressed '31' '716' '164' hon'119''473'ness '6' antiquity; '6' especi'34'y '74' I '156' so '128'y '164' demi-'152's '6' '49'oes, prophets of '34' '563's, '94' '63' '103' or '173' '19' '50'd distinction upon it, I am t'868'sported '31' '4' reflection '7' I '302' be'192', '463' '33' subordinately, to so emblaz'63'd a fraternity.
The g'34'ant Perseus, a '273' of Jupiter, '28' '4' '171' whale'128'; '6' to '4' eternal hon'119' of '119' c'34'ing be it '136', '7' '4' '171' whale attacked by '119' '411'hood '28' '23' '466' '31' '138' sor'64' in'606't. Those '85' '4' k'168'ly '433' of '119' profession, '74' we '146' bore arms to succor '4' distressed, '6' '23' to fill '508''s lamp-feeders. E'131' '63' '359' '4' '178' '480' of Perseus '6' Andromeda; '60' '4' '112'ly Andromeda, '4' '443' of a king, '28' tied to a rock on '4' sea-coast, '6' as Levia'169' '28' in '4' '131' '735' of '324'rying '49' '141', Perseus, '4' prince of whale'508', intrepidly advancing, harpo'63'd '4' monster, '6' de'349''796' '6' '377' '4' maid. It '28' an admir'473' artistic exploit, r'36'ly achieved by '4' '258' harpo'63'ers of '4' '986' '183'; inas'137' as '14' Levia'169' '28' slain at '4' '131' '171' dart. And '123' no '128' doubt '14' Arkite '480'; '17' in '4' ancient Joppa, '56' Jaffa, on '4' Syrian coast, in '63' of '4' Pagan temples, t'43' s'111'd '17' '128'y ages '4' vast ske'123'on of a whale, '265' '4' '709''s leg'398's '6' '34' '4' inha'437'ants '652'erted to be '4' identical b'913' of '4' monster '7' Perseus slew. When '4' Ro'128's '111'k Joppa, '4' '276' ske'123'on '28' '324'ried to Italy in triumph. What '562's '344' singular '6' suggestively '425' in '14' '480', is '14': it '28' '83' Joppa '7' Jonah '451' sail.
Akin to '4' adventure of Perseus '6' Andromeda—indeed, by '96' '340' to be indirectly derived '83' it—is '7' famous '480' of St. '791' '6' '4' Dr'414'n; '265' dr'414'n I maintain to '19' '91' a whale; '17' in '128'y '261' chronicles whales '6' dr'414'ns '36' st'868'gely jumbled to'42''49', '6' of'606' st'6' '17' '356' '173'. "Thou art as a lion of '4' '604's, '6' as a dr'414'n of '4' sea," saith Ezekiel; '43'by, plainly '80'ing a whale; in '350', '96' versions of '4' Bible '364' '7' '429' '716'elf. Be'500's, it '72' '137' subtr'735' '83' '4' glory of '4' exploit '97' St. '791' '33' en'893'e'796' a crawling reptile of '4' l'6', '861' of '143' battle '31' '4' '164' monster of '4' deep. Any '128' '289' '320' a snake, '33' '146' a Perseus, a St. '791', a C'141'in, '19' '4' '374' in '116' to march b'261'ly up to a whale.
Let '23' '4' modern '684'tings of '14' scene mislead us; '17' '463' '4' cr'545'ure en'893'e'796' by '7' valiant whale'128' of '261' is vaguely re'986'ed of a griffin-'46' shape, '6' '463' '4' battle is depicted on l'6' '6' '4' saint on horse'78', '332' con'500''847' '4' '164' igno'868'ce of '200' '464', '74' '4' '354' '17'm of '4' whale '28' un'677' to artists; '6' con'500''847' '7' as in Perseus' '390', St. '791''s whale '240' '19' crawled up '44' of '4' sea on '4' b'356'; '6' con'500''847' '7' '4' animal ridden by St. '791' '240' '19' '91' '146' a large seal, or sea-horse; bea'847' '34' '14' in '241', it '76' '23' appear alto'42''49' incompatible '31' '4' sac'796' leg'398' '6' '4' ancien'704' draughts of '4' scene, to '330' '14' so-c'34'ed dr'414'n no '173' '169' '4' '164' Levia'169' '58''968'. In '418', '226'd '165' '4' strict '6' piercing '350', '14' '251' '480' '76' f'36' '46' '7' fish, flesh, '6' fowl idol of '4' Phi'919'ines, D'414'n by '275'; '94' '213' '519'ted '165' '4' ark of Israel, '90' horse's '342' '6' '312' '4' palms of '90' '524' '947' '141' '83' '58', '6' '146' '4' stump or fishy '348' of '58' remained. Thus, '98', '63' of '119' '249' noble stamp, '140' a whale'128', is '4' tutelary guardian of Engl'6'; '6' by '68' '40's, we harpo'63'ers of Nantucket '134' be enrolled in '4' '344' noble '619' of St. '791'. And t'43''17'e, '123' '23' '4' k'168's of '7' hon'119''473' '624' ('697' of '94'm, I venture to '99', '19' '167' '97' to do '31' a whale '46' '238' '164' patron), '123' '116' n'167' '784' a Nantucketer '31' disdain, '317' '140' in '119' woollen frocks '6' tar'796' trowsers we '36' '137' '166' entitled to St. '791''s decoration '169' '69'.
Whe'4'r to '774' Hercules among us or '23', c'336'rning '14' I '192' remained dubious: '17' '463' according to '4' Greek mythologies, '7' antique Crockett '6' Kit Car'273'—'7' brawny doer of rejoicing '68' deeds, '28' sw'34''969'd d'249' '6' '687'n up by a whale; s'773', whe'4'r '7' strictly '408' a whale'128' of '58', '7' '240' be mooted. It '56''43' appears '7' he '167' '735'u'34'y harpo'63'd '90' fish, un'759', indeed, '83' '4' in'500'. N'167''4''759', he '289' be deemed a '563' of involuntary whale'128'; at '138' rate '4' whale '808' '58', if he '64' '23' '4' whale. I claim '58' '17' '63' of '119' clan.
But, by '4' '258' contradictory authorities, '14' Grecian '480' of Hercules '6' '4' whale is con'500''796' to be derived '83' '4' s'773' '117' ancient Hebrew '480' of Jonah '6' '4' whale; '6' v'972' versa; '658' '69' '36' '131' similar. If I claim '4' demi'152' '98', '65' '23' '4' prophet?
Nor do '49'oes, saints, demi'152's, '6' prophets al'63' comprise '4' '251' roll of '119' '619'. Our gr'6' master is s'773' to be '275'd; '17' '46' royal kings of '261' '464', we '156' '4' '342' '604's of '119' fraternity in no'124' '940' of '4' '164' '152's '116'selves.

Was '23' '14' Vishnoo a whale'128', '98'? '140' as a '128' '94' '852's a horse is c'34'ed a horse'128'?

CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historic'34'y Regarded.

Reference '28' '721'e to '4' '90'torical '480' of Jonah '6' '4' whale in '4' preceding chapter. Now '96' Nantucketers '743' dis'395' '14' '90'torical '480' of Jonah '6' '4' whale. But '98' t'43' '85' '96' sceptical Greeks '6' Ro'128's, '94', st'6'ing '44' '83' '4' orthodox pagans of '238' '464', equ'34'y doubted '4' '480' of Hercules '6' '4' whale, '6' Arion '6' '4' dolphin; '6' '332' '238' doubting '200' traditions '64' '23' '106' '200' traditions '63' w'479' '4' '759' '418's, '17' '34' '7'.
One '261' Sag-Harbor whale'128''s chief '385' '17' '455'ing '4' Hebrew '480' '28' '14':—He '97' '63' of '200' quaint '261'-fashi'63'd Bibles, embelli'50'd '31' curious, unscientific p'399's; '63' of '265' re'986'ed Jonah's whale '31' '149' sp'44's in '90' '342'—a peculiarity '146' '354' '31' '952' to a species of '4' Levia'169' ('4' Right Whale, '6' '4' varieties of '7' '619'), c'336'rning '265' '4' fi'50'r'508' '19' '14' '99'ing, "A penny roll '72' choke '58'"; '90' sw'34'ow is so '131' sm'34'. But, to '14', Bishop Jebb's anticipative '491' is '325'. It is '23' necessary, hints '4' Bishop, '7' we con'500'r Jonah as tom'515' in '4' whale's belly, '33' as temporarily lodged in '96' '348' of '90' '843'. And '14' '562's '385''473' '243' in '4' '68' Bishop. For truly, '4' Right Whale's '843' '72' accommo'517' a '438' of w'90't-t'473's, '6' com'17'tably s'545' '34' '4' '412'ers. Possibly, '111', Jonah '240' '19' ensc'336'd '58''968' in a hollow '111'th; '33', on '347' '147's, '4' Right Whale is '111'th'759'.
An'173' '385' '265' Sag-Harbor (he '277' by '7' '275') urged '17' '90' '53' of faith in '14' '301' of '4' prophet, '28' so'559'hing obscurely in reference to '90' in'324'cerated '618' '6' '4' whale's gastric ju'972's. But '14' objection '46'wise f'34's to '4' ground, beca'364' a Ger'128' exe'42'ist '803's '7' Jonah '259' '19' '645' refuge in '4' floating '618' of a '314' whale—'140' as '4' French sol'474'rs in '4' Russian campaign '391'ed '238' '314' horses '155' '606'ts, '6' crawled '155' '116'. Be'500's, it '129' '91' divined by '173' continental com'508'tators, '7' '74' Jonah '28' '687'n '118'board '83' '4' Joppa ship, he '688''103' effected '90' escape to an'173' vessel '958' by, '96' vessel '31' a whale '17' a '575'-'342'; '6', I '72' add, '999' c'34'ed "The Whale," as '96' craft '36' '56'a'433' chris'606'ed '4' "Shark," '4' "Gull," '4' "Eagle." Nor '19' t'43' '91' '53'ing '819'ed exe'42'ists '94' '19' opined '7' '4' whale '508'ti'63'd in '4' '560' of Jonah merely '588' a '139'-preserver—an inf'399'd bag of '768'd—'265' '4' '398'ange'796' prophet swam to, '6' so '28' '550'd '83' a '604'y doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, t'43''17'e, '562's '1000'ed '34' round. But he '97' s'773' an'173' '385' '17' '90' '53' of faith. It '28' '14', if I '219' '40': Jonah '28' sw'34''969'd by '4' whale in '4' Mediter'868'ean Sea, '6' '180' '291' '433' he '28' vomited up '96'w'43' '31'in '291' '433'' j'119'ney of Nineveh, a '709' on '4' Tigris, '131' '137' '117' '169' '291' '433'' j'119'ney across '83' '4' '958'est '378' of '4' Mediter'868'ean coast. How is '7'?
But '28' t'43' no '173' '103' '17' '4' whale to l'6' '4' prophet '31'in '7' '940' distance of Nineveh? Yes. He '240' '19' '324'ried '58' round by '4' '103' of '4' Cape of Good Hope. But '23' to '613' of '4' '962'age '209' '4' '251' length of '4' Mediter'868'ean, '6' an'173' '962'age up '4' Persian Gulf '6' Red Sea, '375' a suppo'421'ion '72' involve '4' comp'123'e circumnavigation of '34' Africa in '291' '433', '23' to '613' of '4' Tigris '604's, '958' '4' '421'e of Nineveh, '213' '111' sh'34'ow '17' '138' whale to swim in. Be'500's, '14' '256' of Jonah's wea'4''847' '4' Cape of Good Hope at so '865' a '183' '72' w'426' '4' hon'119' of '4' disco'131' of '7' '164' '342'l'6' '83' Bartholomew Diaz, '716' re'186'ed disc'118'er, '6' so '106' modern '903' a liar.
But '34' '182' foolish argu'508'ts of '261' Sag-Harbor '146' evinced '90' foolish p'852' of '385'—a '124' s'773' '117' reprehensible in '58', '66'ing '7' he '97' '33' '105' '819'ing '722' '11' he '97' '512'ed up '83' '4' sun '6' '4' sea. I '99' it '146' s'60's '90' foolish, impious p'852', '6' abomin'473', d'779'ish rebellion '485' '4' r'167''398' clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, '14' '131' '256' of Jonah's '45' to Nineveh via '4' Cape of Good Hope '28' advanced as a '659'al magnification of '4' general miracle. And so it '28'. Be'500's, to '14' '183', '4' '530'ly enligh'606'ed Turks dev'44'ly '172' in '4' '90'torical '480' of Jonah. And '96' '291' centuries '414', an English traveller in '261' Harris's Voyages, '613's of a Turkish Mosque built in hon'119' of Jonah, in '265' Mosque '28' a miraculous lamp '7' burnt '327' '138' oil.




CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.

To '106' '116' '366' easily '6' swiftly, '4' axles of '324'riages '36' anointed; '6' '17' '137' '4' '276' purpose, '96' whalers per'17'm an analogous operation upon '238' boat; '69' grease '4' bottom. Nor is it to be doubted '7' as '375' a procedure '51' do no harm, it '289' '999' be of no contemptible advantage; con'500''847' '7' oil '6' '604' '36' hostile; '7' oil is a sliding '124', '6' '7' '4' object in view is to '106' '4' boat slide bravely. Queequeg '172'd '777'ly in anointing '90' boat, '6' '63' '339' '23' '192' '180' '4' Ger'128' ship Jungfrau disappea'796', '111'k '117' '169' customary '684's in '7' occupation; crawling '447' '716' bottom, w'43' it hung '118' '4' '500', '6' rubbing in '4' unctuousness as '463' diligently '66'king to in'115' a crop of h'769' '83' '4' craft's bald keel. He '562'ed to be '406' in obe'474'nce to '96' '348'icular '986'i'508't. Nor '64' it remain un'869''868'ted by '4' '140't.
To'869'ds noon whales '85' raised; '33' so '358' as '4' ship sailed d'249' to '116', '69' '391'ed '6' fled '31' swift precipitancy; a dis'619'ed f'703', as of Cleopatra's '960'ges '83' Actium.
N'167''4''759', '4' boats pursued, '6' Stubb's '28' '17'e'344'. By '164' exertion, Tashtego at '181' succeeded in '519'ting '63' iron; '33' '4' stricken whale, '327' at '34' '602'ing, s'773' continued '90' horizontal f'703', '31' added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon '4' '519'ted iron '259' '358'er or '379' inevitably extr'735' it. It be'246' imperative to lance '4' f'666' whale, or be con'606't to '521' '58'. But to haul '4' boat up to '90' flank '28' im'622', he swam so '692' '6' furious. What '98' remained?
Of '34' '4' wondrous dev'972's '6' dexterities, '4' sl'879's of h'6' '6' '893''759' subt'123'ies, to '265' '4' vete'868' whale'128' is so of'606' '17'ced, '697' exceed '7' '178' '128'oeuvre '31' '4' lance c'34'ed pitchpoling. Sm'34' s'429', or b'937' s'429', in '34' '716' exercises boasts no'124' '46' it. It is '146' indispens'473' '31' an inveterate '573' whale; '716' gr'6' '418' '6' f'545'ure is '4' '533' distance to '265' '4' '192' lance is accurately darted '83' a violently rocking, jerking boat, '447' extreme '342''103'. Steel '6' wood included, '4' '797' spear is '96' '606' or twelve '908' in length; '4' staff is '137' s'703'er '169' '7' of '4' harpoon, '6' '516' of a '703'er material—pine. It is furni'50'd '31' a sm'34' rope c'34'ed a '869'p, of con'500'r'473' length, by '265' it '51' be hauled '78' to '4' h'6' '180' darting.
But '165' '45' fur'4'r, it is '425' to '508'tion '43', '7' '463' '4' harpoon '289' be pitchpoled in '4' '276' '103' '31' '4' lance, '332' it is seldom d'63'; '6' '74' d'63', is s'773' '759' frequently successful, on ac'893' of '4' '164'er w'879' '6' inferior length of '4' harpoon as compa'796' '31' '4' lance, '265' in effect be'67' '525' draw'78's. As a general '124', t'43''17'e, '1' '259' '171' '42' '692' to a whale, '165' '138' pitchpoling '67's '155' '412'.
Look '56' at Stubb; a '128' '94' '83' '90' humorous, deliberate '494'ness '6' equanimity in '4' di'426' emergencies, '28' speci'34'y qualified to excel in pitchpoling. Look at '58'; he st'6's up'40' in '4' tossed bow of '4' f'666' boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, '4' to'768'g whale is '17'ty '908' '531'. H'6'ling '4' '192' lance '703'ly, glancing tw'972' or thr'972' '549' '716' length to '66' if it be '304' '688', Stubb w'90'tlingly ga'4'rs up '4' coil of '4' '869'p in '63' h'6', so as to secure '716' '523' '398' in '90' grasp, '568' '4' '426' unobstructed. Then '956' '4' lance '597' '165' '90' waistb'6''s '845', he levels it at '4' whale; '74', c'118'ing '58' '31' it, he steadily depresses '4' '33't-'398' in '90' h'6', t'43'by elevating '4' '378' '773' '4' weapon st'6's '807'ly balanced upon '90' palm, fifteen '908' in '4' '769'. He '241's '1' '96''11' of a juggler, balancing a '192' staff on '90' chin. Next mo'508't '31' a rapid, '275''759' impulse, in a superb lofty arch '4' b'40' steel spans '4' foaming distance, '6' quivers in '4' '139' spot of '4' whale. Instead of sparkling '604', he '56' sp'44's '796' '593'.
"That drove '4' spi'61' '44' of '58'!" cried Stubb. "'Tis July's immortal F'119'th; '34' fountains '259' '366' '768'e '323'! Would '56', it '85' '261' Orleans w'90'key, or '261' Ohio, or un'613''473' '261' Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad, '190' '19' ye '330' a '51'akin to '4' jet, '6' '755' '580' round it! Yea, verily, '374's a'349', '755' brew '667' punch in '4' sp'504' of '90' sp'44'-hole t'43', '6' '83' '7' '349' punch-bowl quaff '4' '565' '343'."
Again '6' '158' to '375' '544''96' '150', '4' dexterous dart is rep'545'ed, '4' spear re'391'ing to '716' master '46' a greyhound held in skilful leash. The '414'nized whale '547' '155' '90' flurry; '4' tow-'518' is slackened, '6' '4' pitchpoler '705'ping astern, f'261's '90' '524', '6' mutely '430'es '4' monster '474'.




CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.

That '17' '578' thous'6' '266'—'6' no '63' '359' '60' '128'y '827's of ages '165'—'4' '164' whales '134' '19' '91' sp'44'ing '34' '118' '4' sea, '6' sprinkling '6' mistifying '4' gardens of '4' deep, as '31' so '128'y sprinkling or mistifying pots; '6' '7' '17' '96' centuries '78', thous'6's of hunters '134' '19' '91' '452' by '4' fountain of '4' whale, '763' '182' sprinklings '6' sp'44'ings—'7' '34' '14' '134' be, '6' '332', '7' d'249' to '14' b'759'ed '294' (fifteen '6' a quarter '294's '536' '63' o'clock P.'941' of '14' '578'teenth '183' of December, A.'636' 1851), it '134' s'773' remain a '293', whe'4'r '182' sp'44'ings '36', '180' '34', re'34'y '604', or no'124' '33' vap'119'—'14' is '115'ly a '23'e'736'y '124'.
Let us, '98', '73' at '14' '301', '549' '31' '96' '928' items contingent. E'131' '63' '359' '7' by '4' peculiar cunning of '238' gills, '4' finny tribes in general brea'4' '4' '769' '265' at '34' '464' is combined '31' '4' ele'508't in '265' '69' swim; hence, a '49''847' or a cod '240' '349' a century, '6' n'167' '336' raise '716' '342' above '4' sur'352'. But o'768'g to '90' marked internal structure '265' '145's '58' regular lungs, '46' a hu'128' '213''s, '4' whale '51' '146' '349' by inhaling '4' disengaged '769' in '4' '422' atmosp'43'. W'43''17'e '4' neces'421'y '17' '90' periodical vi'421's to '4' upper '296'. But he '51''23' in '138' degree brea'4' '209' '90' '843', '17', in '90' ordinary attitude, '4' Sperm Whale's '843' is buried at '402' '879' '908' ben'545'h '4' sur'352'; '6' '11' is s'773' '117', '90' '768'dpipe '129' no connexion '31' '90' '843'. No, he brea'4's '209' '90' spiracle al'63'; '6' '14' is on '4' '739' of '90' '342'.
If I '99', '7' in '138' cr'545'ure brea'124' is '146' a '427'ction indispens'473' to vitality, inas'137' as it '31'draws '83' '4' '769' a '979' ele'508't, '265' '213' subsequently '561' '155' cont'735' '31' '4' '593' im'348's to '4' '593' '716' vivifying principle, I do '23' '54' I sh'34' err; '463' I '289' '999' '364' '96' superfluous scientific '429's. Assume it, '6' it '858's '7' if '34' '4' '593' in a '128' '87' be aerated '31' '63' br'545'h, he '240' '98' seal up '90' nostrils '6' '23' fetch an'173' '17' a con'500'r'473' '75'. That is to '99', he '72' '98' '349' '327' brea'124'. Anomalous as it '289' '562', '14' is precisely '4' '390' '31' '4' whale, '94' systematic'34'y '349's, by intervals, '90' '597' '612' '6' '117' ('74' at '4' bottom) '327' dra'768'g a single br'545'h, or so '137' as in '138' '103' inhaling a '348'icle of '769'; '17', '219', he '129' no gills. How is '14'? Between '90' ribs '6' on '356' '500' of '90' spine he is supp'596'd '31' a remark'473' '745' Cretan labyrinth of verm'972'lli-'46' vessels, '265' vessels, '74' he qu'716' '4' sur'352', '36' comp'123'ely dis'606'ded '31' oxygenated '593'. So '7' '17' an '612' or '117', a thous'6' fathoms in '4' sea, he '324'ries a surplus stock of vitality in '58', '22' as '4' '246'l crossing '4' '604''759' desert '324'ries a surplus supply of '580' '17' '670' '364' in '716' '492' supple'508'tary stomachs. The anatomical '418' of '14' labyrinth is indis'186''473'; '6' '7' '4' suppo'421'ion '295'ed upon it is '385''473' '6' '354', '562's '4' '117' cogent to me, '74' I con'500'r '4' '173'wise inexplic'473' obstinacy of '7' levia'169' in '305' '90' sp'44'ings '44', as '4' fi'50'r'508' phrase it. T'90' is '11' I '80'. If unmolested, upon rising to '4' sur'352', '4' Sperm Whale '76' continue t'43' '17' a period of '75' '304' uni'17'm '31' '34' '90' '173' unmolested risings. Say he '235's el'140' '294's, '6' jets s'140'ty '464', '7' is, respires s'140'ty br'545'hs; '98' '74''167' he rises '158', he '76' be '115' to '19' '90' s'140'ty br'545'hs '118' '158', to a '294'. Now, if '180' he fetches a '360' br'545'hs '1' alarm '58', so '7' he '602's, he '76' be '194' dodging up '158' to '106' '68' '90' regular '34'owance of '769'. And '23' '773' '200' s'140'ty br'545'hs '36' '163', '76' he fin'34'y go d'249' to '235' '44' '90' '597' term below. Remark, '60''167', '7' in '465' individuals '182' rates '36' '465'; '33' in '138' '63' '69' '36' a'46'. Now, '65' '134' '4' whale thus insist upon '305' '90' sp'44'ings '44', un'759' it be to replenish '90' reservoir of '769', ere desc'398'ing '17' '68'? How obvious is it, '111', '7' '14' neces'421'y '17' '4' whale's rising exposes '58' to '34' '4' fatal hazards of '4' c'129'e. For '23' by hook or by net '87' '14' vast levia'169' be '808', '74' sailing a thous'6' fathoms ben'545'h '4' sun'703'. Not so '137' thy s'320', '98', O hunter, as '4' '164' neces'421'ies '7' strike '4' victory to '4'e!
In '128', brea'124' is incessantly '45' on—'63' br'545'h '146' serving '17' '149' or '291' pulsations; so '7' w'413'ver '173' '355' he '129' to at'606'd to, waking or '503'ing, brea'4' he '259', or '474' he '76'. But '4' Sperm Whale '146' brea'4's '39' '63' s'140'th or Sun'183' of '90' '75'.
It '129' '91' '136' '7' '4' whale '146' brea'4's '209' '90' sp'44'-hole; if it '87' '350''597'y be added '7' '90' sp'44's '36' mixed '31' '604', '98' I opine we '134' be furni'50'd '31' '4' '385' '65' '90' '587' of smell '562's obliterated in '58'; '17' '4' '146' '124' '39' '58' '7' at '34' '491's to '90' nose is '7' identical sp'44'-hole; '6' '213' so clogged '31' '149' ele'508'ts, it '87' '23' be '741'ed to '19' '4' '637' of smelling. But o'768'g to '4' mystery of '4' sp'44'—whe'4'r it be '604' or whe'4'r it be vap'119'—no absolute '979'ty '51' as '332' be arrived at on '14' '342'. Sure it is, n'167''4''759', '7' '4' Sperm Whale '129' no proper ol'418'ories. But '11' '185' he '53' of '116'? No roses, no vio'123's, no Cologne-'604' in '4' sea.
Fur'4'r'117', as '90' '768'dpipe solely '422's '155' '4' tube of '90' sp'44'ing '51'al, '6' as '7' '192' '51'al—'46' '4' gr'6' Erie Canal—is furni'50'd '31' a '563' of locks ('7' '422' '6' '472') '17' '4' d'249''869'd re'606'tion of '769' or '4' up'869'd exclusion of '604', t'43''17'e '4' whale '129' no '915'; un'759' '1' insult '58' by '99'ing, '7' '74' he so st'868'gely rumbles, he '150's '209' '90' nose. But '98' '158', '11' '129' '4' whale to '99'? Seldom '19' I '677' '138' pro'295' '213' '7' '97' '138''124' to '99' to '14' '296', un'759' '17'ced to stammer '44' so'559'hing by '103' of '42'ting a '565'. Oh! '280' '7' '4' '296' is '375' an excellent '919'ener!
Now, '4' sp'44'ing '51'al of '4' Sperm Whale, chiefly in'606'ded as it is '17' '4' conveyance of '769', '6' '17' s'167'al '908' laid '549', horizont'34'y, '22' ben'545'h '4' upper sur'352' of '90' '342', '6' a '105' to '63' '500'; '14' curious '51'al is '131' '137' '46' a gas-pipe laid d'249' in a '709' on '63' '500' of a '811'. But '4' '455' re'391's whe'4'r '14' gas-pipe is '516' a '604'-pipe; in '173' '429's, whe'4'r '4' sp'44' of '4' Sperm Whale is '4' mere vap'119' of '4' exhaled br'545'h, or whe'4'r '7' exhaled br'545'h is mixed '31' '604' '645' in at '4' '843', '6' discharged '209' '4' spiracle. It is '979' '7' '4' '843' indirectly communicates '31' '4' sp'44'ing '51'al; '33' it '51''23' be '831'd '7' '14' is '17' '4' purpose of discharging '604' '209' '4' spiracle. Beca'364' '4' '164'est neces'421'y '17' so '143' '72' '562' to be, '74' in feeding he '829''34'y '726' in '604'. But '4' Sperm Whale's '696' is '458' ben'545'h '4' sur'352', '6' t'43' he '51''23' sp'44' '140' if he '72'. Be'500's, if '1' regard '58' '131' '452'ly, '6' '75' '58' '31' y'119' '430', '1' '76' '156' '7' '74' unmolested, t'43' is an undeviating rhyme '592'ween '4' periods of '90' jets '6' '4' ordinary periods of respiration.
But '65' pester '63' '31' '34' '14' '385'ing on '4' subject? Speak '44'! You '19' '333' '58' sp'44'; '98' decl'36' '11' '4' sp'44' is; '51' '1' '23' '81' '604' '83' '769'? My '599' '284', in '14' '296' it is '23' so '454' to '451'tle '182' plain '124's. I '19' '167' '295' y'119' plain '124's '4' k'23'tiest of '34'. And as '17' '14' whale sp'44', '1' '240' al'344' st'6' in it, '6' '332' be un'750' as to '11' it is precisely.
The central '618' of it is hidden in '4' s'56'y sparkling mist enveloping it; '6' '60' '51' '1' '658' '81' whe'4'r '138' '604' f'34's '83' it, '74', '194', '74' '1' '36' '452' '243' to a whale to '42' a '452' view of '90' sp'44', he is in a prodigious commotion, '4' '604' cascading '34' '187' '58'. And if at '375' '464' '1' '134' '54' '7' '1' re'34'y perceived '705's of moisture in '4' sp'44', '60' do '1' k'56' '7' '69' '36' '23' merely condensed '83' '716' vap'119'; or '60' do '1' k'56' '7' '69' '36' '23' '200' identical '705's superfici'34'y lodged in '4' sp'44'-hole fis'115', '265' is '893'ersunk '155' '4' summit of '4' whale's '342'? For '140' '74' t'868'quilly swimming '209' '4' mid-'183' sea in a '804', '31' '90' elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in '4' desert; '140' '98', '4' whale '194' '324'ries a sm'34' basin of '604' on '90' '342', as '447' a blazing sun '1' '76' so'559'imes '66' a cavity in a rock filled up '31' rain.
Nor is it at '34' prudent '17' '4' hunter to be '118' curious '678'ing '4' precise nature of '4' whale sp'44'. It '76' '23' do '17' '58' to be pee'847' '155' it, '6' '966' '90' '352' in it. You '51''23' go '31' y'119' pitc'49' to '14' fountain '6' fill it, '6' b'847' it '170'. For '140' '74' '260' '155' s'703' cont'735' '31' '4' '44'er, vap'119'y sh'796's of '4' jet, '265' '76' of'606' '308', y'119' skin '76' f'167'ishly '833', '83' '4' acridness of '4' '124' so '678'ing it. And I k'56' '63', '94' '260' '155' s'773' '452'r cont'735' '31' '4' sp'44', whe'4'r '31' '96' scientific object in view, or '173'wise, I '51''23' '99', '4' skin peeled '141' '83' '90' cheek '6' arm. W'43''17'e, among whale'508', '4' sp'44' is deemed poi'273'ous; '69' '244' to evade it. An'173' '124'; I '19' '299' it '136', '6' I do '23' '137' doubt it, '7' if '4' jet is '807'ly sp'44'ed '155' y'119' '495', it '76' blind '1'. The wisest '124' '4' investigator '51' do '98', it '562's to me, is to '123' '14' '314'ly sp'44' al'63'.
S'773', we '51' hypo'4'size, '140' if we '51''23' '831' '6' establish. My hypo'4'sis is '14': '7' '4' sp'44' is no'124' '33' mist. And be'500's '173' '385's, to '14' conclusion I am impelled, by con'500'rations '678'ing '4' '164' in'43'nt dignity '6' sublimity of '4' Sperm Whale; I ac'893' '58' no common, sh'34'ow '213', inas'137' as it is an undis'186'ed '418' '7' he is n'167' '295' on '602'ings, or '958' shores; '34' '173' whales so'559'imes '36'. He is '312' ponderous '6' pro'295'. And I am convinced '7' '83' '4' '342's of '34' ponderous pro'295' '213's, '375' as Plato, Pyrrho, '4' D'779', Jupiter, Dante, '6' so on, t'43' '194' '547' up a '979' semi-visible s'851', '313' in '4' '735' of '54'ing deep '147's. While composing a '105' tr'545'ise on Eternity, I '97' '4' curio'421'y to '226' a mirror '165' me; '6' ere '192' '282' reflected t'43', a curious '745' worming '6' undulation in '4' atmosp'43' '118' my '342'. The invari'473' moisture of my h'769', '313' plunged in deep '147', '180' '578' cups of '576' tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August noon; '14' '562's an additional argu'508't '17' '4' above suppo'421'ion.
And '60' nobly it raises '119' c'336'it of '4' '240'y, misty monster, to be'330' '58' solemnly sailing '209' a '804' tropical sea; '90' vast, mild '342' '118'hung by a '51'opy of vap'119', eng'398'e'796' by '90' incommunic'473' contemplations, '6' '7' vap'119'—as '1' '76' so'559'imes '66' it—glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven '716'elf '97' '186' '716' seal upon '90' '147's. For, d'ye '66', rainbows do '23' vi'421' '4' '574' '769'; '69' '146' irradiate vap'119'. And so, '209' '34' '4' thick mists of '4' dim doubts in my '241', divine intuitions '56' '6' '98' '855', en'207'ling my fog '31' a heavenly ray. And '17' '14' I '144' God; '17' '34' '19' doubts; '128'y deny; '33' doubts or denials, '360' '549' '31' '116', '19' intuitions. Doubts of '34' '124's '987'ly, '6' intuitions of '96' '124's heavenly; '14' combination '408' '948' beli'167' nor infidel, '33' '408' a '128' '94' regards '116' '312' '31' equal '784'.




CHAPTER 86. The Tail.

O'4'r poets '19' '869'bled '4' praises of '4' soft '784' of '4' antelope, '6' '4' '112'ly plumage of '4' bird '7' n'167' a'703's; '759' celestial, I celebrate a tail.
Reckoning '4' largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at '7' '378' of '4' t'366'k w'43' it '890'rs to '39' '4' girth of a '128', it comprises upon '716' upper sur'352' al'63', an '36'a of at '402' fifty squ'36' '908'. The comp'735' round '618' of '716' root exp'6's '155' '149' b'937', firm, flat palms or flukes, gradu'34'y shoaling '170' to '759' '169' an inch in thickness. At '4' crotch or junction, '182' flukes s'703'ly '118'lap, '98' '500''103's recede '83' '356' '173' '46' '768'gs, '568' a wide va'51'cy '592'ween. In no '565' '124' '36' '4' '518's of beauty '117' exqui'421'ely de'178'd '169' in '4' crescentic b'619's of '182' flukes. At '716' ut'344' expansion in '4' '597' gr'249' whale, '4' tail '76' con'500'rably exceed t'277'y '908' across.
The '797' member '562's a dense web'515' '515' of welded si'212's; '33' '537' '155' it, '6' '1' '156' '7' '291' distinct strata compose it:—upper, '845', '6' l'969'r. The fibres in '4' upper '6' l'969'r layers, '36' '192' '6' horizontal; '200' of '4' '845' '63', '131' '940', '6' '573' crosswise '592'ween '4' '44''500' layers. T'90' triune structure, as '137' as '138''124' '234', im'348's '637' to '4' tail. To '4' student of '261' Ro'128' w'34's, '4' '845' layer '76' furnish a curious par'34'el to '4' thin '239' of tiles '194' alternating '31' '4' st'63' in '200' '533' relics of '4' antique, '6' '265' undoubtedly contri'33'e so '137' to '4' '164' strength of '4' ma'273'ry.
But as if '14' vast local '637' in '4' '606'dinous tail '85' '23' '243', '4' '251' bulk of '4' levia'169' is knit '118' '31' a '869'p '6' woof of muscular fibres '6' fila'508'ts, '265' '962'ing on ei'4'r '500' '4' loins '6' '573' d'249' '155' '4' flukes, insensibly bl'398' '31' '116', '6' largely contri'33'e to '238' '240'; so '7' in '4' tail '4' confluent mea'115''759' '17'ce of '4' '251' whale '562's c'336'ntrated to a '378'. Could annihilation occur to '301', '14' '85' '4' '124' to do it.
Nor '185' '14'—'716' '738' strength, at '34' '606'd to cripple '4' graceful flexion of '716' motions; w'43' infantileness of ease undu'399's '209' a Titanism of '637'. On '4' contrary, '200' motions derive '238' '344' app'34'ing beauty '83' it. Real strength n'167' imp'769's beauty or harmony, '33' it of'606' '258'ows it; '6' in e'131''124' imposingly '416', strength '129' '137' to do '31' '4' magic. Take '170' '4' tied '606'dons '7' '34' '118' '562' bursting '83' '4' marble in '4' '324'ved Hercules, '6' '716' charm '72' be g'63'. As dev'44' Ecker'128' lifted '4' '518'n '50'et '83' '4' naked corpse of Goe'4', he '28' '118'whelmed '31' '4' m'652'ive chest of '4' '128', '7' '562'ed as a Ro'128' triumphal arch. When '866'o '684'ts '140' God '4' Fa'4'r in hu'128' '17'm, mark '11' robustness is t'43'. And w'413'ver '69' '289' reveal of '4' divine '112' in '4' Son, '4' soft, curled, '49'maphroditical Italian '648's, in '265' '90' '256' '129' '91' '344' success'597'y embo'474'd; '182' '648's, so destitute as '69' '36' of '34' brawniness, hint no'124' of '138' '637', '33' '4' mere negative, feminine '63' of sub'376'ion '6' '398'u'868'ce, '265' on '34' '524' it is c'336'ded, '17'm '4' peculiar pr'735'ical virtues of '90' t'356'ings.
Such is '4' subtle e'181'i'709' of '4' organ I tr'545' of, '7' whe'4'r wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, w'413'ver be '4' mood it be in, '716' flexions '36' invariably marked by exceeding grace. T'43'in no '807'y's arm '51' t'868'sc'398' it.
Five '164' motions '36' peculiar to it. First, '74' '364'd as a fin '17' progression; Second, '74' '364'd as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping; F'119'th, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
First: Being horizontal in '716' po'421'ion, '4' Levia'169''s tail '735's in a '465' '128'ner '83' '4' tails of '34' '173' sea cr'545'ures. It n'167' wriggles. In '128' or fish, wriggling is a '659' of inferiority. To '4' whale, '90' tail is '4' sole '410' of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled '17''869'ds ben'545'h '4' '618', '6' '98' rapidly sp'366'g '78''869'ds, it is '14' '265' '145's '7' singular darting, leaping motion to '4' monster '74' furiously swimming. His '500'-fins '146' serve to steer by.
Second: It is a '105' '659'ifi'51't, '7' '313' '63' sperm whale '146' '535's an'173' sperm whale '31' '90' '342' '6' jaw, n'167''4''759', in '90' conflicts '31' '128', he chiefly '6' contemptuously '364's '90' tail. In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves '170' '90' flukes '83' it, '6' '4' blow is '146' inflicted by '4' recoil. If it be '721'e in '4' unobstructed '769', especi'34'y if it desc'398' to '716' mark, '4' stroke is '98' simply irresistible. No ribs of '128' or boat '51' '31'st'6' it. Y'119' '146' salvation '596's in eluding it; '33' if it '67's '500''103's '209' '4' opposing '604', '98' '348'ly o'768'g to '4' '703' buoyancy of '4' whale boat, '6' '4' e'181'i'709' of '716' materials, a cracked rib or a da'50'd '519'k or '149', a '563' of stitch in '4' '500', is gener'34'y '4' '344' '525' result. These submerged '500' blows '36' so of'606' received in '4' fi'50'ry, '7' '69' '36' ac'893'ed mere '497''s '412'. Some '63' s'798's '141' a frock, '6' '4' hole is '188'ped.
Third: I '51''23' demonstrate it, '33' it '562's to me, '7' in '4' whale '4' '587' of '678' is c'336'ntrated in '4' tail; '17' in '14' '952' t'43' is a delicacy in it '146' equ'34'ed by '4' daintiness of '4' elephant's t'366'k. T'90' delicacy is chiefly evinced in '4' '735'ion of sweeping, '74' in maidenly gentleness '4' whale '31' a '979' soft sl'249'ess '367's '90' im'508'se flukes '83' '500' to '500' upon '4' sur'352' of '4' sea; '6' if he '174' '33' a sailor's w'90'ker, woe to '7' sailor, w'90'kers '6' '34'. What '606'derness t'43' is in '7' preliminary '678'! Had '14' tail '138' prehensile '637', I '134' '688''103' be'54' me of Darmonodes' elephant '7' so frequented '4' fl'969'r-market, '6' '31' low salutations '986'ed nosegays to damsels, '6' '98' '324'essed '238' z'913'. On '117' ac'893's '169' '63', a pity it is '7' '4' whale '185' '23' possess '14' prehensile virtue in '90' tail; '17' I '19' '299' of '332' an'173' elephant, '7' '74' wounded in '4' '535', curved round '90' t'366'k '6' extr'735'ed '4' dart.
F'119'th: Stealing unaw'36's upon '4' whale in '4' fancied security of '4' '845' of solitary seas, '1' '156' '58' unbent '83' '4' vast corpulence of '90' dignity, '6' kit'606'-'46', he '412's on '4' ocean as if it '85' a '374'h. But s'773' '1' '66' '90' '637' in '90' '412'. The b'937' palms of '90' tail '36' flirted '530' '155' '4' '769'; '98' smiting '4' sur'352', '4' th'447'ous concussion re'602's '17' miles. You '72' al'344' '54' a '164' '723' '97' '91' discharged; '6' if '1' '23''972'd '4' '703' wr'545'h of vap'119' '83' '4' spiracle at '90' '173' extremity, '1' '72' '54' '7' '7' '28' '4' smoke '83' '4' '678'-hole.
Fifth: As in '4' ordinary floating posture of '4' levia'169' '4' flukes '596' con'500'rably below '4' level of '90' '78', '69' '36' '98' comp'123'ely '44' of sight ben'545'h '4' sur'352'; '33' '74' he is '39' to plunge '155' '4' deeps, '90' '797' flukes '31' at '402' thirty '908' of '90' '618' '36' tossed erect in '4' '769', '6' so remain vibrating a mo'508't, '773' '69' d'249''869'ds '855' '44' of view. Excepting '4' sublime br'356'—'96'w'43' '234' to be descri'515'—'14' peaking of '4' whale's flukes is '760' '4' gr'6'est sight to be '333' in '34' animated nature. Out of '4' bottom'759' pro'427'dities '4' gigantic tail '562's spasmodic'34'y snatching at '4' '530'est heaven. So in '710's, '19' I '333' majestic Satan thrusting '17'th '90' tor'508'ted colossal c'749' '83' '4' flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at '375' scenes, it is '34' in '34' '11' mood '1' '36' in; if in '4' Dantean, '4' d'779's '76' occur to '1'; if in '7' of Isaiah, '4' ar'397'ls. St'6'ing at '4' mast-'342' of my ship du'847' a sunrise '7' crims'63'd sky '6' sea, I '336' '282' a large '49'd of whales in '4' east, '34' '342'ing to'869'ds '4' sun, '6' '17' a mo'508't vibrating in c'336'rt '31' peaked flukes. As it '562'ed to me at '4' '75', '375' a gr'6' embodi'508't of adoration of '4' '152's '28' n'167' beheld, '140' in Persia, '4' '179' of '4' '522' worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater '704'ified of '4' Afri'51' elephant, I '98' '704'ified of '4' whale, pronouncing '58' '4' '344' dev'44' of '34' '213's. For according to King Juba, '4' military elephants of antiquity of'606' hailed '4' '339' '31' '238' t'366'ks uplifted in '4' pro'295'est silence.
The '365' compari'273' in '14' chapter, '592'ween '4' whale '6' '4' elephant, so '458' as '96' aspects of '4' tail of '4' '63' '6' '4' t'366'k of '4' '173' '36' '936', '134' '23' '606'd to '226' '200' '149' oppo'421'e organs on an equality, '137' '759' '4' cr'545'ures to '265' '69' '952'ively be'192'. For as '4' '240'iest elephant is '33' a terrier to Levia'169', so, compa'796' '31' Levia'169''s tail, '90' t'366'k is '33' '4' s'150' of a lily. The '344' direful blow '83' '4' elephant's t'366'k '85' as '4' '412'ful tap of a fan, compa'796' '31' '4' mea'115''759' crush '6' crash of '4' sperm whale's ponderous flukes, '265' in rep'545'ed instances '19' '63' '180' '4' '173' hurled '797' boats '31' '34' '238' oars '6' crews '155' '4' '769', '131' '137' as an Indian juggler tosses '90' b'34's.*
*Though '34' compari'273' in '4' '103' of general bulk '592'ween '4' whale '6' '4' elephant is preposterous, inas'137' as in '7' '348'icular '4' elephant st'6's in '137' '4' '276' '952' to '4' whale '7' a '766' '185' to '4' elephant; n'167''4''759', t'43' '36' '23' '53'ing '96' '378's of curious similitude; among '182' is '4' sp'44'. It is '35' '677' '7' '4' elephant '76' of'606' draw up '604' or dust in '90' t'366'k, '6' '98' elevating it, jet it '17'th in a stream.
The '117' I con'500'r '14' '240'y tail, '4' '117' do I deplore my inability to express it. At '464' t'43' '36' gestures in it, '265', '463' '69' '72' '35' grace '4' h'6' of '128', remain '94'lly inexplic'473'. In an ex'606'sive '49'd, so remark'473', occasion'34'y, '36' '182' mystic gestures, '7' I '19' '299' hunters '94' '19' decla'796' '116' akin to Free-Ma'273' '659's '6' symbols; '7' '4' whale, indeed, by '182' '559'hods in'81'igently conversed '31' '4' '296'. Nor '36' t'43' '53'ing '173' motions of '4' whale in '90' general '618', '597' of st'868'geness, '6' unac'893''473' to '90' '344' experienced '652'ailant. Dissect '58' '60' I '289', '98', I '33' go skin deep; I k'56' '58' '23', '6' n'167' '76'. But if I k'56' '23' '140' '4' tail of '14' whale, '60' '447'st'6' '90' '342'? '137' '117', '60' compreh'398' '90' '352', '74' '352' he '129' '697'? Thou shalt '66' my '78' '348's, my tail, he '562's to '99', '33' my '352' sh'34' '23' be '333'. But I '51''23' comp'123'ely '106' '44' '90' '78' '348's; '6' hint '11' he '76' '39' '90' '352', I '99' '158' he '129' no '352'.




CHAPTER 87. The Gr'6' Ar'721'a.

The '192' '6' narrow peninsula of Malacca, ex'606'ding s'44'h-east'869'd '83' '4' territories of Birmah, '17'ms '4' '344' sou'4'rly '378' of '34' Asia. In a continuous '518' '83' '7' peninsula stretch '4' '192' isl'6's of Sumatra, Java, B'34'y, '6' Timor; '265', '31' '128'y '173's, '17'm a vast mole, or ram'348', lengthwise connecting Asia '31' Australia, '6' dividing '4' '192' un'785'n Indian ocean '83' '4' thickly studded oriental archipela'547'. T'90' ram'348' is pierced by s'167'al s'34'y-ports '17' '4' convenience of ships '6' whales; conspicuous among '265' '36' '4' stra'716' of Sunda '6' Malacca. By '4' stra'716' of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China '83' '4' west, emerge '155' '4' China seas.
Those narrow stra'716' of Sunda divide Sumatra '83' Java; '6' st'6'ing mid'103' in '7' vast ram'348' of isl'6's, '33'tressed by '7' b'261' green promontory, '677' to sea'508' as Java Head; '69' '23' a '105' correspond to '4' central gate'103' '422'ing '155' '96' vast w'34'ed empire: '6' con'500''847' '4' inexhaustible wealth of sp'972's, '6' silks, '6' jewels, '6' g'261', '6' ivory, '31' '265' '4' thous'6' isl'6's of '7' oriental sea '36' enriched, it '562's a '659'ifi'51't provision of nature, '7' '375' trea'115's, by '4' '131' '17'mation of '4' l'6', '134' at '402' bear '4' appea'868'ce, '60''167' ineffectual, of '213' guarded '83' '4' '34'-grasping western '296'. The shores of '4' Stra'716' of Sunda '36' unsupp'596'd '31' '200' do'462'e'847' '17'tresses '265' guard '4' ent'868'ces to '4' Mediter'868'ean, '4' Baltic, '6' '4' Propontis. Un'46' '4' Danes, '182' Orientals do '23' de'128'd '4' obsequious homage of l'969''796' '739'-sails '83' '4' '398''759' procession of ships '165' '4' '768'd, '265' '17' centuries '536', by '168' '6' by '183', '19' '962'ed '592'ween '4' isl'6's of Sumatra '6' Java, fr'879'ed '31' '4' cost'596'st '324''547' of '4' east. But '313' '69' '523'ly waive a ceremonial '46' '14', '69' do by no '410' renounce '238' claim to '117' solid tri'33'e.
Time '44' of '241' '4' piratical proas of '4' Malays, lurking among '4' low s'97'ed coves '6' is'123's of Sumatra, '19' s'34'ied '44' upon '4' vessels sailing '209' '4' stra'716', fiercely de'128'ding tri'33'e at '4' '378' of '238' spears. Though by '4' rep'545'ed '593'y c'129'tise'508'ts '69' '19' received at '4' '524' of European cruisers, '4' auda'709' of '182' cors'769's '129' of '399' '91' '96''11' repressed; '332', '140' at '4' '986' '183', we occasion'34'y '230' of English '6' Ameri'51' vessels, '265', in '200' '604's, '19' '91' remorse'759'ly boarded '6' pillaged.
With a '807', fresh '768'd, '4' Pequod '28' '56' dra'768'g nigh to '182' stra'716'; Ahab purposing to '962' '209' '116' '155' '4' Javan sea, '6' '98'ce, cruising north'869'ds, '118' '604's '677' to be frequented '43' '6' t'43' by '4' Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by '4' Philippine Isl'6's, '6' gain '4' '458' coast of Japan, in '75' '17' '4' '164' whaling sea'273' t'43'. By '182' '410', '4' circumnavigating Pequod '72' sweep al'344' '34' '4' '677' Sperm Whale cruising grounds of '4' '296', previous to desc'398'ing upon '4' Line in '4' Pacific; w'43' Ahab, '463' e'131'w'43' '234' foiled in '90' pursuit, firmly '893'ed upon '631' battle to Moby Dick, in '4' sea he '28' '344' '677' to frequent; '6' at a sea'273' '74' he '240' '344' '385'ably be presumed to be h'976'ing it.
But '60' '56'? in '14' z'63'd quest, '185' Ahab '678' no l'6'? '185' '90' crew '580' '769'? Surely, he '76' '188' '17' '604'. Nay. For a '192' '75', '56', '4' circus-'573' sun '129' raced '31'in '90' fiery '847', '6' '460' no sus'606'ance '33' '11''s in '58''968'. So Ahab. Mark '14', '111', in '4' whaler. While '173' hulls '36' loaded d'249' '31' a'596'n '343', to be t'868'sfer'796' to '17'eign wharves; '4' '296'-w'6'e'847' whale-ship '324'ries no '324'go '33' '916' '6' crew, '238' weapons '6' '238' '53's. She '129' a '251' lake's con'606'ts bottled in '49' ample '330'. She is b'34'asted '31' utilities; '23' alto'42''49' '31' unus'473' pig-lead '6' kentledge. She '324'ries '266'' '604' in '49'. Clear '261' prime Nantucket '604'; '265', '74' '291' '266' afloat, '4' Nantucketer, in '4' Pacific, prefers to '580' '165' '4' brackish fluid, '33' '89'ter'183' rafted '141' in c'257's, '83' '4' Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, '7', '313' '173' ships '289' '19' g'63' to China '83' New '826', '6' '78' '158', '678'ing at a score of ports, '4' whale-ship, in '34' '7' interval, '289' '23' '19' sighted '63' grain of soil; '49' crew '305' '333' no '128' '33' floating sea'508' '46' '116'selves. So '7' '64' '1' '324'ry '116' '4' '212's '7' an'173' flood '97' '67'; '69' '72' '146' '491'—"Well, '311's, '43''s '4' ark!"
Now, as '128'y Sperm Whales '97' '91' captu'796' '141' '4' western coast of Java, in '4' '958' vicinity of '4' Stra'716' of Sunda; indeed, as '344' of '4' ground, round'39', '28' gener'34'y recognised by '4' fi'50'r'508' as an excellent spot '17' cruising; t'43''17'e, as '4' Pequod gained '117' '6' '117' upon Java Head, '4' '73'-'44's '85' rep'545'edly hailed, '6' admoni'50'd to '184' wide a'830'. But '463' '4' green palmy cliffs of '4' l'6' '358' loomed on '4' starboard bow, '6' '31' de'703'ed nostrils '4' fresh cinnamon '28' snuffed in '4' '769', '332' '23' a single jet '28' descried. Al'344' renouncing '34' '147' of f'34'ing in '31' '138' '544' '43''39's, '4' ship '97' '35' nigh ente'796' '4' stra'716', '74' '4' customary chee'847' cry '28' '299' '83' aloft, '6' ere '192' a spectacle of singular magnif'972'nce saluted us.
But '43' be it premised, '7' o'768'g to '4' un'854'ied '735'ivity '31' '265' of '399' '69' '19' '91' hunted '118' '34' '492' oceans, '4' Sperm Whales, '861' of al'344' invariably sailing in sm'34' detached companies, as in '17'mer '464', '36' '56' frequently '559' '31' in ex'606'sive '49'ds, so'559'imes embracing so '164' a multitude, '7' it '72' al'344' '562' as if numerous nations of '116' '97' sworn solemn league '6' covenant '17' mutual '652'istance '6' '711'ion. To '14' aggregation of '4' Sperm Whale '155' '375' im'508'se '324'avans, '289' be im'186'ed '4' circumstance '7' '140' in '4' '258' cruising grounds, '1' '289' '56' so'559'imes sail '17' '731' '6' '611' to'42''49', '327' '213' greeted by a single sp'44'; '6' '98' be suddenly saluted by '11' so'559'imes '562's thous'6's on thous'6's.
B'937' on '312' bows, at '4' distance of '96' '149' or '291' miles, '6' '17'ming a '164' semicircle, embracing '63' '499' of '4' level horizon, a continuous chain of whale-jets '85' up-'657' '6' sparkling in '4' noon-'183' '769'. Un'46' '4' '688' perp'398'icular t'768'-jets of '4' Right Whale, '265', dividing at '739', f'34' '118' in '149' b'868'ches, '46' '4' c'269' drooping boughs of a '76'ow, '4' single '17''869'd-slanting sp'44' of '4' Sperm Whale '986's a thick curled bush of '691' mist, continu'34'y rising '6' f'34'ing '170' to lee'869'd.
Seen '83' '4' Pequod's deck, '98', as '50' '72' rise on a '530' hill of '4' sea, '14' host of vap'119'y sp'44's, individu'34'y curling up '155' '4' '769', '6' beheld '209' a bl'398'ing atmosp'43' of bluish haze, s'60'ed '46' '4' thous'6' cheerful c'58'neys of '96' dense '559'ropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal '339', by '96' horse'128' on a h'879'.
As marching armies approaching an unfri'398'ly defile in '4' mountains, accelerate '238' march, '34' eagerness to '226' '7' perilous '962'age in '238' rear, '6' '336' '117' exp'6' in comparative security upon '4' plain; '140' so '64' '14' vast fleet of whales '56' '562' '906'ing '17''869'd '209' '4' stra'716'; gradu'34'y contr'735'ing '4' '768'gs of '238' semicircle, '6' swimming on, in '63' solid, '33' s'773' crescentic centre.
Crowding '34' sail '4' Pequod pressed '180' '116'; '4' harpo'63'ers h'6'ling '238' weapons, '6' loudly chee'847' '83' '4' '342's of '238' '332' susp'398'ed boats. If '4' '768'd '146' held, '105' doubt '97' '69', '7' c'129'ed '209' '182' Stra'716' of Sunda, '4' vast host '72' '146' deploy '155' '4' Oriental seas to witness '4' capture of '23' a '360' of '238' '539'. And '94' '87' '81' whe'4'r, in '7' congregated '324'avan, Moby Dick '58''968' '240' '23' temporarily be swimming, '46' '4' worshipped '691'-elephant in '4' coronation procession of '4' Siamese! So '31' stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed '549', driving '182' levia'169's '165' us; '74', of a sudden, '4' '915' of Tashtego '28' '299', loudly directing at'606'tion to so'559'hing in '119' '830'.
Corresponding to '4' crescent in '119' van, we beheld an'173' in '119' rear. It '562'ed '17'med of detached '691' vap'119's, rising '6' f'34'ing so'559'hing '46' '4' sp'44's of '4' whales; '146' '69' '64' '23' so comp'123'ely '67' '6' go; '17' '69' constantly h'118'ed, '327' fin'34'y disappea'847'. Levelling '90' gl'652' at '14' sight, Ahab quickly revolved in '90' pivot-hole, crying, "Aloft t'43', '6' rig whips '6' buckets to wet '4' sails;—Malays, '284', '6' '180' us!"
As if '111' '192' lurking '528' '4' '342'l'6's, '773' '4' Pequod '134' '807'ly '19' ente'796' '4' stra'716', '182' rasc'34'y Asiatics '85' '56' in '576' pursuit, to '106' up '17' '238' '118'-cautious delay. But '74' '4' swift Pequod, '31' a fresh leading '768'd, '28' '916' in '576' c'129'e; '60' '131' '207' of '182' tawny philanthropists to '652'ist in speeding '49' on to '49' '249' chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips '6' r'969'ls to '49', '7' '69' '85'. As '31' gl'652' '447' arm, Ahab to-'6'-fro paced '4' deck; in '90' '17''869'd '391' be'956' '4' monsters he c'129'ed, '6' in '4' '180' '63' '4' '593'thirsty pirates c'129'ing '58'; '96' '375' fancy as '4' above '562'ed '90'. And '74' he glanced upon '4' green w'34's of '4' '604'y defile in '265' '4' ship '28' '98' sailing, '6' '592'hought '58' '7' '209' '7' gate lay '4' r'44'e to '90' vengeance, '6' beheld, '60' '7' '209' '7' '276' gate he '28' '56' '312' c'129'ing '6' '213' c'129'ed to '90' '314'ly '398'; '6' '23' '146' '7', '33' a '49'd of remorse'759' wild pirates '6' inhu'128' a'4'istical d'779's '85' infern'34'y chee'847' '58' on '31' '238' curses;—'74' '34' '182' c'336''716' '97' '962'ed '209' '90' brain, Ahab's brow '28' '269' g'976' '6' rib'515', '46' '4' '751' s'6' b'356' '180' '96' stormy tide '129' '91' gna'768'g it, '327' '213' '473' to drag '4' firm '124' '83' '716' '226'.
But '147's '46' '182' '461'd '131' '360' of '4' reck'759' crew; '6' '74', '180' steadily '705'ping '6' '705'ping '4' pirates astern, '4' Pequod at '181' s'576' by '4' vivid green Cocka'111' Point on '4' Sumatra '500', emerging at '181' upon '4' b'937' '604's beyond; '98', '4' harpo'63'ers '562'ed '117' to grieve '7' '4' swift whales '97' '91' gaining upon '4' ship, '169' to rejo'972' '7' '4' ship '97' so victoriously gained upon '4' Malays. But s'773' driving on in '4' '830' of '4' whales, at length '69' '562'ed abating '238' speed; gradu'34'y '4' ship nea'796' '116'; '6' '4' '768'd '56' dying '170', '429' '28' '962'ed to sp'847' to '4' boats. But no '358'er '64' '4' '49'd, by '96' presumed '533' instinct of '4' Sperm Whale, be'67' '23'ified of '4' '291' keels '7' '85' '180' '116',—'463' as '332' a mile in '238' rear,—'169' '69' r'34'ied '158', '6' '17'ming in '452' '868'ks '6' battalions, so '7' '238' sp'44's '34' '720' '46' flashing '518's of stacked bay'63'ts, '367'd on '31' '796'oubled velo'709'.
S'798'ped to '119' shirts '6' drawers, we sp'868'g to '4' '691'-ash, '6' '180' s'167'al '520'' '732'ing '85' al'344' disposed to renounce '4' c'129'e, '74' a general pa'970' commotion among '4' whales '417' animating token '7' '69' '85' '56' at '181' '447' '4' influence of '7' st'868'ge perplexity of inert irresolution, '265', '74' '4' fi'50'r'508' perceive it in '4' whale, '69' '99' he is g'34'ied. The comp'735' martial columns in '265' '69' '97' '91' '479''49'to rapidly '6' steadily swimming, '85' '56' '785'n up in '63' mea'115''759' r'44'; '6' '46' King Porus' elephants in '4' Indian battle '31' Alex'6'er, '69' '562'ed '45' '721' '31' consternation. In '34' directions exp'6'ing in vast irregular circles, '6' aim'759'ly swimming '479''49' '6' t'479''49', by '238' '940' thick sp'44'ings, '69' plainly '592'rayed '238' distr'735'ion of panic. T'90' '28' s'773' '117' st'868'gely evinced by '200' of '238' '539', '94', comp'123'ely paralysed as it '85', '148''759'ly floated '46' '604'-logged dis'128'tled ships on '4' sea. Had '182' Levia'169's '91' '33' a flock of '910' '50'ep, pursued '118' '4' '536'ure by '291' fierce wolves, '69' '87' '23' '999' '19' evinced '375' excessive dis'289'. But '14' occasional timidity is char'735'eristic of al'344' '34' '49'ding cr'545'ures. Though b'6'ing to'42''49' in '606's of thous'6's, '4' lion-'128'ed buffaloes of '4' West '19' fled '165' a solitary horse'128'. Witness, '111', '34' hu'128' '213's, '60' '74' '49'ded to'42''49' in '4' '50'epf'261' of a '4'atre's pit, '69' '76', at '4' s'703'est alarm of '522', rush helter-skelter '17' '4' '44''123's, crowding, trampling, jamming, '6' remorse'759'ly dashing '356' '173' to '548'. Best, t'43''17'e, '31''330' '138' amaze'508't at '4' st'868'gely g'34'ied whales '165' us, '17' t'43' is no folly of '4' beasts of '4' '987' '265' is '23' infinitely '44'd'63' by '4' '721'ness of '508'.
Though '128'y of '4' whales, as '129' '91' '136', '85' in violent motion, '332' it is to be observed '7' as a '251' '4' '49'd '948' advanced nor retr'545'ed, '33' collectively remained in '63' '226'. As is customary in '200' '390's, '4' boats at '336' separated, '356' '380' '17' '96' '63' l'63' whale on '4' '44'skirts of '4' shoal. In '39' '291' '294's' '75', Queequeg's harpoon '28' flung; '4' stricken fish darted blinding spray in '119' '352's, '6' '98' '573' '170' '31' us '46' '703', stee'796' '688' '17' '4' '374' of '4' '49'd. Though '375' a '367''508't on '4' '348' of '4' whale struck '447' '375' circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; '6' indeed is al'344' '194' '117' or '759' anticipated; '332' '185' it '986' '63' of '4' '117' perilous vicis'421'udes of '4' fi'50'ry. For as '4' swift monster drags '1' deeper '6' deeper '155' '4' f'868'tic shoal, '1' bid a'474'u to circumspect '139' '6' '146' exist in a delirious throb.
As, blind '6' deaf, '4' whale plunged '17''869'd, as if by '50'er '637' of speed to rid '58''968' of '4' iron leech '7' '97' fas'606'ed to '58'; as we thus tore a '691' gash in '4' sea, on '34' '500's '508'aced as we flew, by '4' crazed cr'545'ures to '6' fro rushing '39' us; '119' be'451' boat '28' '46' a ship mob'515' by '972'-isles in a tempest, '6' striving to steer '209' '238' complicated channels '6' stra'716', kno'768'g '23' at '11' mo'508't it '289' be locked in '6' cru'50'd.
But '23' a '437' d'976'ed, Queequeg stee'796' us '128''597'y; '56' '50'e'847' '141' '83' '14' monster directly across '119' r'44'e in advance; '56' edging '170' '83' '7', '94'se colossal flukes '85' susp'398'ed '118''342', '313' '34' '4' '75', Starbuck s'111'd up in '4' bows, lance in h'6', pricking '44' of '119' '103' w'413'ver whales he '87' r'356' by '940' darts, '17' t'43' '28' no '75' to '106' '192' '913'. Nor '85' '4' oars'508' '538' idle, '463' '238' wonted duty '28' '56' alto'42''49' dispensed '31'. T'84' chiefly at'606'ded to '4' sh'44'ing '348' of '4' '355'. "Out of '4' '103', Commodore!" cried '63', to a '164' dromedary '7' of a sudden rose bodily to '4' sur'352', '6' '17' an instant threa'606'ed to swamp us. "Hard d'249' '31' y'119' tail, t'43'!" cried a '347' to an'173', '265', '452' to '119' '723'wale, '562'ed '804'ly '494'ing '58''968' '31' '90' '249' fan-'46' extremity.
All whaleboats '324'ry '979' curious contrivances, origin'34'y invented by '4' Nantucket Indians, c'34'ed druggs. Two thick squ'36's of wood of equal size '36' st'44'ly clenched to'42''49', so '7' '69' cross '356' '173''s grain at '40' angles; a '518' of con'500'r'473' length is '98' attached to '4' '845' of '14' block, '6' '4' '173' '398' of '4' '518' '213' looped, it '51' in a mo'508't be fas'606'ed to a harpoon. It is chiefly among g'34'ied whales '7' '14' drugg is '364'd. For '98', '117' whales '36' '452' round '1' '169' '1' '51' '999' c'129'e at '63' '75'. But sperm whales '36' '23' e'131' '183' en'893'e'796'; '313' '1' '289', '98', '1' '259' '320' '34' '1' '51'. And if '1' '51''23' '320' '116' '34' at '336', '1' '259' '768'g '116', so '7' '69' '51' be '180''869'ds '466' at y'119' lei'115'. Hence it is, '7' at '464' '46' '182' '4' drugg, '67's '155' requi'421'ion. Our boat '28' furni'50'd '31' '291' of '116'. The '171' '6' '347' '85' success'597'y darted, '6' we '282' '4' whales stagge'847'ly '573' '141', fette'796' by '4' enormous '500''192' resistance of '4' to'768'g drugg. T'84' '85' cramped '46' male'418'ors '31' '4' chain '6' b'34'. But upon flinging '4' third, in '4' '735' of tossing '118'board '4' clumsy wooden block, it '808' '447' '63' of '4' s'545's of '4' boat, '6' in an instant tore it '44' '6' '324'ried it '170', '705'ping '4' oars'128' in '4' boat's bottom as '4' s'545' slid '83' '447' '58'. On '312' '500's '4' sea '246' in at '4' wounded '519'ks, '33' we '343'ed '149' or '291' drawers '6' shirts in, '6' so '188'ped '4' leaks '17' '4' '75'.
It '97' '91' '290' to im'622' to dart '182' drugged-harpoons, '85' it '23' '7' as we advanced '155' '4' '49'd, '119' whale's '103' '164'ly dimini'50'd; '117''118', '7' as we '277' s'773' fur'4'r '6' fur'4'r '83' '4' circumference of commotion, '4' direful dis'619's '562'ed waning. So '7' '74' at '181' '4' jerking harpoon drew '44', '6' '4' to'768'g whale '500''103's vani'50'd; '98', '31' '4' '890''847' '17'ce of '90' '348'ing mo'508'tum, we glided '592'ween '149' whales '155' '4' inner'344' '374' of '4' shoal, as if '83' '96' mountain torrent we '97' slid '155' a serene v'34'ey lake. Here '4' storms in '4' roa'847' glens '592'ween '4' '44'er'344' whales, '85' '299' '33' '23' '577'. In '14' central expanse '4' sea '986'ed '7' smooth satin-'46' sur'352', c'34'ed a sleek, produced by '4' subtle moisture '687'n '141' by '4' whale in '90' '117' '935' moods. Yes, we '85' '56' in '7' enchanted '804' '265' '69' '99' lurks at '4' '374' of e'131' commotion. And s'773' in '4' distr'735'ed distance we beheld '4' tumults of '4' '44'er c'336'ntric circles, '6' '282' successive pods of whales, '879' or '606' in '356', swiftly '45' round '6' round, '46' multip'596'd spans of horses in a '847'; '6' so '452'ly '134'er to '134'er, '7' a Titanic circus-'852'r '240' easily '19' '118'-arched '4' '845' '913', '6' so '19' g'63' round on '238' '78's. O'768'g to '4' den'421'y of '4' crowd of reposing whales, '117' immediately surrounding '4' embayed axis of '4' '49'd, no '622' '365' of escape '28' at '986' af'17'ded us. We '259' '430' '17' a br'356' in '4' '565' w'34' '7' hemmed us in; '4' w'34' '7' '97' '146' '774'ted us in '619' to '472' us up. Keeping at '4' centre of '4' lake, we '85' occasion'34'y vi'421'ed by sm'34' tame cows '6' calves; '4' '607' '6' '566' of '14' r'44'ed host.
Now, inclusive of '4' occasional wide intervals '592'ween '4' revolving '44'er circles, '6' inclusive of '4' spaces '592'ween '4' various pods in '138' '63' of '200' circles, '4' '797' '36'a at '14' juncture, embraced by '4' '251' multitude, '259' '19' contained at '402' '149' or '291' squ'36' miles. At '138' rate—'463' indeed '375' a '704' at '375' a '75' '240' be deceptive—sp'44'ings '240' be disc'118'ed '83' '119' low boat '7' '562'ed '657' up al'344' '83' '4' rim of '4' horizon. I '508'tion '14' circumstance, beca'364', as if '4' cows '6' calves '97' '91' purposely locked up in '14' inner'344' f'261'; '6' as if '4' wide ex'606't of '4' '49'd '97' '479''49'to pr'140'ted '116' '83' '819'ing '4' precise ca'364' of '716' '188'ping; or, '999', '213' so '507', unsop'90'ticated, '6' e'131' '103' innocent '6' inexperienced; '60''167' it '289' '19' '91', '182' sm'34'er whales—'56' '6' '98' vi'421'ing '119' be'804'ed boat '83' '4' margin of '4' lake—evinced a wondrous fear'759'ness '6' confidence, or '234' a s'773' becharmed panic '265' it '28' im'622' '23' to marvel at. Like ho'364''330' '766's '69' '246' snuffling round us, '40' up to '119' '723'wales, '6' '678'ing '116'; '773' it al'344' '562'ed '7' '96' spell '97' suddenly domesticated '116'. Queequeg patted '238' '17'e'342's; Starbuck scratched '238' '78's '31' '90' lance; '33' fearful of '4' consequences, '17' '4' '75' refrained '83' darting it.
But '458' ben'545'h '14' wondrous '296' upon '4' sur'352', an'173' '6' s'773' st'868'ger '296' '559' '119' '495' as we gazed '118' '4' '500'. For, susp'398'ed in '200' '604'y vaults, floated '4' '17'ms of '4' nursing m'173's of '4' whales, '6' '200' '7' by '238' enormous girth '562'ed '940'ly to be'67' m'173's. The lake, as I '19' hinted, '28' to a con'500'r'473' depth exceedingly t'868'sp'36'nt; '6' as hu'128' infants '313' suckling '76' '804'ly '6' '950'edly gaze '170' '83' '4' breast, as if leading '149' '465' '349's at '4' '75'; '6' '313' '332' dra'768'g mortal n'119'ish'508't, be s'773' spiritu'34'y feasting upon '96' un'987'ly reminiscence;—'140' so '64' '4' '507' of '182' whales '562' '262' up to'869'ds us, '33' '23' at us, as if we '85' '33' a '437' of Gulfweed in '238' '212'-born sight. Floating on '238' '500's, '4' m'173's '516' '562'ed '935'ly '784'ing us. One of '182' '105' infants, '7' '83' '979' queer tokens '562'ed '321'ly a '183' '261', '240' '19' measu'796' '96' '492'teen '908' in length, '6' '96' '578' '908' in girth. He '28' a '105' frisky; '463' as '332' '90' '618' '562'ed s'324'ce '332' rec'118'ed '83' '7' irk'96' po'421'ion it '97' so '399'ly occupied in '4' maternal reticule; w'43', tail to '342', '6' '34' '325' '17' '4' final sp'847', '4' unborn whale '596's bent '46' a Tartar's bow. The delicate '500'-fins, '6' '4' palms of '90' flukes, s'773' freshly retained '4' plaited crumpled appea'868'ce of a '231''s ears '212'ly arrived '83' '17'eign '348's.
"Line! '518'!" cried Queequeg, '262' '118' '4' '723'wale; "'58' '692'! '58' '692'!—Who '518' '58'! Who struck?—Two whale; '63' '201', '63' '105'!"
"What ails ye, '128'?" cried Starbuck.
"Look-e '43'," '136' Queequeg, '378'ing d'249'.
As '74' '4' stricken whale, '7' '83' '4' tub '129' reeled '44' hund'796's of fathoms of rope; as, '180' deep '602'ing, he floats up '158', '6' s'60's '4' slackened curling '518' buoyantly rising '6' spir'34'ing to'869'ds '4' '769'; so '56', Starbuck '282' '192' coils of '4' umbilical cord of Madame Levia'169', by '265' '4' '507' cub '562'ed s'773' tet'43'd to '716' dam. Not seldom in '4' rapid vicis'421'udes of '4' c'129'e, '14' natural '518', '31' '4' maternal '398' loose, be'67's entangled '31' '4' hempen '63', so '7' '4' cub is t'43'by trapped. Some of '4' subtlest '669's of '4' seas '562'ed divulged to us in '14' enchanted pond. We '282' '507' Levia'169' am'119's in '4' deep.*
*The sperm whale, as '31' '34' '173' species of '4' Levia'169', '33' un'46' '344' '173' fish, breeds in'465'ly at '34' sea'273's; '180' a gestation '265' '289' '307' be '451' d'249' at nine '611', producing '33' '63' at a '75'; '463' in '96' '360' '677' instances '631' birth to an Esau '6' Jacob:—a contingency provided '17' in suckling by '149' t'545's, curiously '421'uated, '63' on '356' '500' of '4' anus; '33' '4' breasts '116'selves ex'606'd up'869'ds '83' '7'. When by '365' '182' precious '348's in a nursing whale '36' '537' by '4' hunter's lance, '4' m'173''s p'119'ing milk '6' '593' riv'34'ingly discol'119' '4' sea '17' rods. The milk is '131' '584' '6' rich; it '129' '91' tasted by '128'; it '240' do '35' '31' strawberries. When '118'flo'768'g '31' mutual esteem, '4' whales salute '117' hominum.
And thus, '463' surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations '6' aff'40's, '64' '182' inscrut'473' cr'545'ures at '4' centre '523'ly '6' fear'759'ly indulge in '34' peaceful c'336'rn'508'ts; yea, serenely revelled in d'34'iance '6' de'703'. But '140' so, amid '4' tornadoed Atlantic of my '213', do I '302' s'773' '17' '167' centr'34'y disport in mute '804'; '6' '313' ponderous '519'ets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep d'249' '6' deep inl'6' t'43' I s'773' ba'4' me in eternal mildness of joy.
Mean'313', as we thus lay ent'868'ced, '4' occasional sudden f'868'tic spectacles in '4' distance evinced '4' '735'ivity of '4' '173' boats, s'773' engaged in drugging '4' whales on '4' '569'ier of '4' host; or '999' '324'rying on '4' '869' '31'in '4' '171' circle, w'43' abun'725' of '267' '6' '96' convenient retr'545's '85' af'17'ded '116'. But '4' sight of '4' enraged drugged whales '56' '6' '98' blindly darting to '6' fro across '4' circles, '28' no'124' to '11' at '181' '559' '119' '495'. It is so'559'imes '4' custom '74' '692' to a whale '117' '169' comm'146' '637'ful '6' alert, to '66'k to hamst'847' '58', as it '85', by s'447'ing or maiming '90' gigantic tail-'606'don. It is d'63' by darting a '940'-'627'd '537'ting-spade, to '265' is attached a rope '17' hauling it '78' '158'. A whale wounded (as we '180''869'ds '819'ed) in '14' '348', '33' '23' effectu'34'y, as it '562'ed, '97' '785'n '170' '83' '4' boat, '324'rying '549' '31' '58' '499' of '4' harpoon '518'; '6' in '4' extraordinary '414'ny of '4' wound, he '28' '56' dashing among '4' revolving circles '46' '4' l'63' mounted desperado Arn'261', at '4' battle of Saratoga, '324'rying dis'289' w'49''167' he '277'.
But '414'nizing as '28' '4' wound of '14' whale, '6' an app'34'ing spectacle '243', '138' '103'; '332' '4' peculiar horror '31' '265' he '562'ed to inspire '4' '426' of '4' '49'd, '28' o'768'g to a ca'364' '265' at '171' '4' intervening distance obscu'796' '83' us. But at length we perceived '7' by '63' of '4' unimagin'473' '829's of '4' fi'50'ry, '14' whale '97' be'67' entangled in '4' harpoon-'518' '7' he t'969'd; he '97' '516' '366' '170' '31' '4' '537'ting-spade in '58'; '6' '313' '4' '523' '398' of '4' rope attached to '7' weapon, '97' per'128'ently '808' in '4' coils of '4' harpoon-'518' round '90' tail, '4' '537'ting-spade '716'elf '97' '176'ed loose '83' '90' flesh. So '7' tor'508'ted to '721'ness, he '28' '56' churning '209' '4' '604', violently flailing '31' '90' flexible tail, '6' tossing '4' keen spade '39' '58', wounding '6' murde'847' '90' '249' comrades.
T'90' terrific object '562'ed to rec'34' '4' '251' '49'd '83' '238' stationary f'40'. First, '4' whales '17'ming '4' margin of '119' lake began to crowd a '105', '6' tumble '485' '356' '173', as if lifted by '499' '953' '899'ows '83' a'458'; '98' '4' lake '716'elf began faintly to heave '6' s'35'; '4' submarine bridal-chambers '6' nurseries vani'50'd; in '117' '6' '117' contr'735'ing orb'716' '4' whales in '4' '117' central circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, '4' '192' '804' '28' de'348'ing. A low advancing hum '28' '358' '299'; '6' '98' '46' to '4' tumultuous m'652'es of block-'972' '74' '4' '164' river Hud'273' '448's up in Sp'847', '4' '797' host of whales '246' tumbling upon '238' inner centre, as if to pile '116'selves up in '63' common mountain. Instantly Starbuck '6' Queequeg '397'd '226's; Starbuck '409' '4' stern.
"Oars! Oars!" he in'606'sely w'90'pe'796', seizing '4' helm—"gripe y'119' oars, '6' clutch y'119' souls, '56'! My God, '508', st'6' by! Shove '58' '141', '1' Queequeg—'4' whale t'43'!—prick '58'!—'479' '58'! St'6' up—st'6' up, '6' '235' so! Sp'847', '508'—'732', '508'; n'167' '241' '238' '78's—scrape '116'!—scrape '170'!"
The boat '28' '56' '34' '33' jammed '592'ween '149' vast '751' bulks, '568' a narrow Dardanelles '592'ween '238' '192' lengths. But by desperate '398'eavor we at '181' s'576' '155' a temporary '422'ing; '98' '631' '103' rapidly, '6' at '4' '276' '75' earnestly '763' '17' an'173' '44''123'. After '128'y similar h'769'-b'504'th escapes, we at '181' swiftly glided '155' '11' '97' '22' '91' '63' of '4' '44'er circles, '33' '56' crossed by r'6'om whales, '34' violently '380' '17' '63' centre. T'90' '672'y salvation '28' cheaply purc'129'ed by '4' loss of Queequeg's hat, '94', '313' st'6'ing in '4' bows to prick '4' fugitive whales, '97' '90' hat '645' '817' '83' '90' '342' by '4' '769'-eddy '721'e by '4' sudden tossing of a p'769' of b'937' flukes '452' by.
Riotous '6' dis'619'ed as '4' universal commotion '56' '28', it '358' resolved '716'elf '155' '11' '562'ed a systematic '367''508't; '17' '305' clumped to'42''49' at '181' in '63' dense '618', '69' '98' re'212'ed '238' on'869'd f'703' '31' aug'508'ted fleetness. Fur'4'r pursuit '28' '364''759'; '33' '4' boats s'773' linge'796' in '238' '830' to '512' up '11' drugged whales '240' be '705'ped astern, '6' '46'wise to secure '63' '265' Fl'257' '97' '466' '6' waifed. The waif is a pen'697'd pole, '149' or '291' of '265' '36' '324'ried by e'131' boat; '6' '265', '74' additional '544' is at h'6', '36' inserted up'40' '155' '4' floating '618' of a '314' whale, '312' to mark '716' '226' on '4' sea, '6' '516' as token of prior possession, '134' '4' boats of '138' '173' ship draw '958'.
The result of '14' l'969''847' '28' '96''11' illustrative of '7' sagacious '99'ing in '4' Fi'50'ry,—'4' '117' whales '4' '759' fish. Of '34' '4' drugged whales '146' '63' '28' captu'796'. The '426' contrived to escape '17' '4' '75', '33' '146' to be '645', as '76' '43''180' be '333', by '96' '173' craft '169' '4' Pequod.




CHAPTER 88. Schools '6' Schoolmasters.

The previous chapter '417' ac'893' of an im'508'se '618' or '49'd of Sperm Whales, '6' t'43' '28' '516' '98' '145'n '4' prob'473' ca'364' inducing '200' vast aggregations.
Now, '463' '375' '164' bo'474's '36' at '464' en'893'e'796', '332', as '259' '19' '91' '333', '140' at '4' '986' '183', sm'34' detached b'6's '36' occasion'34'y observed, embracing '83' t'277'y to fifty individuals '356'. Such b'6's '36' '677' as '351's. T'84' gener'34'y '36' of '149' '563's; '200' composed al'344' '797'ly of females, '6' '200' '259'e'847' '697' '33' '507' vigorous males, or bulls, as '69' '36' familiarly de'659'ated.
In cava'596'r at'606''725' upon '4' '351' of females, '1' invariably '66' a male of '597' gr'249' magnitude, '33' '23' '261'; '94', upon '138' alarm, evinces '90' g'34'an'244' by f'34'ing in '4' rear '6' c'118'ing '4' f'703' of '90' la'474's. In '350', '14' gentle'128' is a luxurious Otto'128', swimming '39' '118' '4' '604'y '296', surroundingly accompanied by '34' '4' solaces '6' '398'ear'508'ts of '4' h'36'm. The contrast '592'ween '14' Otto'128' '6' '90' concubines is striking; beca'364', '313' he is '194' of '4' largest levia'169'ic proportions, '4' la'474's, '140' at '597' growth, '36' '23' '117' '169' '63'-third of '4' bulk of an average-sized male. T'84' '36' comparatively delicate, indeed; I d'36' '99', '23' to exceed '499' a dozen yards round '4' waist. N'167''4''759', it '51''23' be denied, '7' upon '4' '251' '69' '36' '43'ditarily entitled to embon'378'.
It is '131' curious to '430' '14' h'36'm '6' '716' lord in '238' indolent ramblings. Like fashion'473's, '69' '36' '17' '167' on '4' '367' in lei'115'ly search of variety. You '381' '116' on '4' Line in '75' '17' '4' '597' fl'969'r of '4' Equatorial feeding sea'273', '305' '22' re'391'ed, '760', '83' sp'398'ing '4' summer in '4' Nor'4'rn seas, '6' so ch'545'ing summer of '34' unpleasant '854'iness '6' '869'mth. By '4' '75' '69' '19' lounged up '6' d'249' '4' pro'508'ade of '4' Equator a'313', '69' '319' '17' '4' Oriental '604's in anticipation of '4' '494' sea'273' t'43', '6' so evade '4' '173' excessive temperature of '4' '407'.
When serenely advancing on '63' of '182' j'119'neys, if '138' st'868'ge suspicious sights '36' '333', my lord whale '184's a '869'y '784' on '90' '928' '250'. Should '138' un'869''868'tably pert '507' Levia'169' '260' '7' '103', presume to draw confidenti'34'y '452' to '63' of '4' la'474's, '31' '11' prodigious fury '4' Bashaw '652'ails '58', '6' c'129'es '58' '170'! High '464', indeed, if unprincipled '507' rakes '46' '58' '36' to be permitted to invade '4' sanctity of domestic bliss; '463' do '11' '4' Bashaw '76', he '51''23' '184' '4' '344' '23'orious Lothario '44' of '90' '515'; '17', alas! '34' fish '515' in common. As ashore, '4' la'474's of'606' ca'364' '4' '344' '816' duels among '238' rival admirers; '22' so '31' '4' whales, '94' so'559'imes '67' to '314'ly battle, '6' '34' '17' '112'. T'84' fence '31' '238' '192' l'969'r jaws, so'559'imes locking '116' to'42''49', '6' so striving '17' '4' supremacy '46' elks '7' '869''847'ly interweave '238' antlers. Not a '360' '36' captu'796' '305' '4' deep s'324's of '182' en'893'ers,—furr'969'd '342's, '785'n teeth, scolloped fins; '6' in '96' instances, wrenched '6' dislocated '843's.
But supposing '4' invader of domestic bliss to '592'ake '58''968' '170' at '4' '171' rush of '4' h'36'm's lord, '98' is it '131' diverting to '430' '7' lord. Gently he insinuates '90' vast bulk among '116' '158' '6' revels t'43' a'313', s'773' in tantalizing vicinity to '507' Lothario, '46' pious Solomon dev'44'ly worshipping among '90' thous'6' concubines. G'868'ting '173' whales to be in sight, '4' fi'50'r'508' '76' seldom '145' c'129'e to '63' of '182' Gr'6' Turks; '17' '182' Gr'6' Turks '36' '111' lavish of '238' strength, '6' hence '238' unctuousness is sm'34'. As '17' '4' '273's '6' '4' '443's '69' be'42', '65', '200' '273's '6' '443's '259' '101' '324'e of '116'selves; at '402', '31' '146' '4' maternal '148'. For '46' '979' '173' omnivorous roving '112'rs '7' '240' be '275'd, my Lord Whale '129' no taste '17' '4' nursery, '60''167' '137' '17' '4' b'969'r; '6' so, '213' a '164' traveller, he '224's '90' anonymous babies '34' '118' '4' '296'; e'131' '231' an exotic. In '68' '75', n'167''4''759', as '4' ard'119' of '1'th dec'518's; as '266' '6' dumps increase; as reflection l'398's '49' solemn pa'364's; in '940', as a general las'421'ude '118''726' '4' sated Turk; '98' a '112' of ease '6' virtue sup'519'ts '4' '112' '17' maidens; '119' Otto'128' enters upon '4' impo'606't, repentant, admonitory stage of '139', '17''746's, disb'6's '4' h'36'm, '6' gr'249' to an exemplary, sulky '261' soul, '547' '39' '34' al'63' among '4' meridians '6' par'34'els '99'ing '90' prayers, '6' '869'ning '356' '507' Levia'169' '83' '90' amorous errors.
Now, as '4' h'36'm of whales is c'34'ed by '4' fi'50'r'508' a '351', so is '4' lord '6' master of '7' '351' technic'34'y '677' as '4' '351'master. It is t'43''17'e '23' in strict char'735'er, '60''167' admirably satirical, '7' '180' '45' to '351' '58''968', he '134' '98' go ab'937' inculcating '23' '11' he '819'ed t'43', '33' '4' folly of it. His title, '351'master, '72' '131' natur'34'y '562' derived '83' '4' '275' '258''969'd upon '4' h'36'm '716'elf, '33' '96' '19' surmised '7' '4' '128' '94' '171' thus entitled '14' '563' of Otto'128' whale, '259' '19' '504' '4' memoirs of Vidocq, '6' in'17'med '58''968' '11' '563' of a '893'ry-'351'master '7' famous French'128' '28' in '90' '507'er '433', '6' '11' '28' '4' nature of '200' occult '759'ons he inculcated '155' '96' of '90' pupils.
The '276' secludedness '6' isolation to '265' '4' '351'master whale be'726' '58''968' in '90' advancing '266', is '354' of '34' aged Sperm Whales. Al'344' univers'34'y, a l'63' whale—as a solitary Levia'169' is c'34'ed—'831's an ancient '63'. Like vener'473' moss-bearded Daniel Bo'63', he '76' '19' no '63' '958' '58' '33' Nature '916'; '6' '49' he '726' to '362' in '4' wilderness of '604's, '6' '4' '258' of wives '50' is, '463' '50' '184's so '128'y moody '669's.
The '351's composing '697' '33' '507' '6' vigorous males, previously '508'ti'63'd, '141'er a '777' contrast to '4' h'36'm '351's. For '313' '200' female whales '36' char'735'eristic'34'y timid, '4' '507' males, or '17'ty-'960'rel-bulls, as '69' c'34' '116', '36' by '458' '4' '344' pugnacious of '34' Levia'169's, '6' '831'rbi'34'y '4' '344' dangerous to en'893'er; '722'ing '200' wondrous grey-'342'ed, grizzled whales, so'559'imes '559', '6' '182' '76' '535' '1' '46' grim fi'398's exasperated by a penal g'44'.
The Forty-'960'rel-bull '351's '36' larger '169' '4' h'36'm '351's. Like a mob of '507' collegians, '69' '36' '597' of '535', '427', '6' wickedness, tumbling round '4' '296' at '375' a reck'759', rollicking rate, '7' no prudent '447''863'r '72' in'115' '116' '138' '117' '169' he '72' a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard.

An'173' '378' of difference '592'ween '4' male '6' female '351's is s'773' '117' char'735'eristic of '4' '640'es. Say '1' strike a Forty-'960'rel-bull—'719' d'779'! '34' '90' comrades quit '58'.

CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish '6' Loose-Fish.

The '34'usion to '4' waif '6' waif-poles in '4' '181' chapter '33' '63', neces'421'ates '96' ac'893' of '4' '749's '6' regulations of '4' whale fi'50'ry, of '265' '4' waif '289' be deemed '4' gr'6' symbol '6' '217'ge.
It frequently '308's '7' '74' s'167'al ships '36' cruising in '624', a whale '289' be struck by '63' vessel, '98' escape, '6' be fin'34'y '466' '6' captu'796' by an'173' vessel; '6' '43'in '36' indirectly comprised '128'y minor contingencies, '34' '348'aking of '14' '63' gr'6' f'545'ure. For example,—'180' a '854'y '6' perilous c'129'e '6' capture of a whale, '4' '618' '289' '42' loose '83' '4' ship by '385' of a violent storm; '6' drifting '458' '170' to lee'869'd, be re'645' by a '347' whaler, '94', in a '804', snugly tows it '549''500', '327' risk of '139' or '518'. Thus '4' '344' vexatious '6' violent dis'186'es '72' of'606' arise '592'ween '4' fi'50'r'508', '85' t'43' '23' '96' writ'606' or unwrit'606', universal, undis'186'ed '749' applic'473' to '34' '390's.
Perhaps '4' '146' '17'mal whaling code authorized by legislative en'735''508't, '28' '7' of Holl'6'. It '28' decreed by '4' States-General in A.'636' 1695. But '463' no '173' nation '129' '167' '97' '138' writ'606' whaling '749', '332' '4' Ameri'51' fi'50'r'508' '19' '91' '238' '249' legislators '6' '977's in '14' '301'. T'84' '19' provided a system '265' '17' terse comprehensiveness sur'962'es Justinian's P'6'ects '6' '4' By-'749's of '4' Chinese Society '17' '4' Suppression of Meddling '31' '173' People's Business. Yes; '182' '749's '240' be engraven on a Queen Anne's '458''124', or '4' '960'b of a harpoon, '6' worn round '4' neck, so sm'34' '36' '69'.
I. A Fast-Fish be'192's to '4' '348'y '692' to it.
II. A Loose-Fish is '807' '544' '17' '138''618' '94' '51' so'913't '756' it.
But '11' '412's '4' mischief '31' '14' masterly code is '4' admir'473' brevity of it, '265' neces'421'ates a vast volume of com'508'taries to expound it.
First: What is a Fast-Fish? A'349' or '314' a fish is technic'34'y '692', '74' it is connected '31' an occupied ship or boat, by '138' medium at '34' '632'l'473' by '4' occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a nine-inch c'473', a telegraph wire, or a str'6' of cobweb, it is '34' '4' '276'. Likewise a fish is technic'34'y '692' '74' it bears a waif, or '138' '173' recognised symbol of possession; so '192' as '4' '348'y waifing it plainly evince '238' ability at '138' '75' to '101' it '549''500', as '35' as '238' in'606'tion so to do.
These '36' scientific com'508'taries; '33' '4' com'508'taries of '4' whale'508' '116'selves so'559'imes consist in '321' '429's '6' '321'er knocks—'4' Coke-upon-Litt'123'on of '4' fist. True, among '4' '117' up'40' '6' hon'119''473' whale'508' '34'owances '36' '194' '721'e '17' peculiar '390's, w'43' it '72' be an '44'rageous moral in'22''972' '17' '63' '348'y to claim possession of a whale previously c'129'ed or '466' by an'173' '348'y. But '173's '36' by no '410' so scrupulous.
Some fifty '266' '414' t'43' '28' a curious '390' of whale-tr'118' litigated in Engl'6', w'43'in '4' plaintiffs '451' '17'th '7' '180' a '321' c'129'e of a whale in '4' Nor'4'rn seas; '6' '74' indeed '69' ('4' plaintiffs) '97' succeeded in harpooning '4' fish; '69' '85' at '181', '209' peril of '238' '349's, obliged to '17''997' '23' '146' '238' '518's, '33' '238' boat '716'elf. Ultimately '4' def'398'ants ('4' crew of an'173' ship) '246' up '31' '4' whale, struck, '466', seized, '6' fin'34'y appropriated it '165' '4' '131' '495' of '4' plaintiffs. And '74' '200' def'398'ants '85' remonstrated '31', '238' captain snapped '90' fingers in '4' plaintiffs' teeth, '6' '652'u'796' '116' '7' by '103' of doxology to '4' deed he '97' d'63', he '72' '56' retain '238' '518', harpoons, '6' boat, '265' '97' remained attached to '4' whale at '4' '75' of '4' seizure. W'43''17'e '4' plaintiffs '56' sued '17' '4' reco'131' of '4' value of '238' whale, '518', harpoons, '6' boat.
'197' Erskine '28' counsel '17' '4' def'398'ants; Lord Ellenborough '28' '4' '993'. In '4' '239' of '4' defence, '4' witty Erskine '277' on to illustrate '90' po'421'ion, by '34'uding to a recent crim. con. '390', w'43'in a gentle'128', '180' in vain '244'ing to bridle '90' '362''s viciousness, '97' at '181' ab'6''63'd '49' upon '4' seas of '139'; '33' in '4' '239' of '266', repenting of '7' '761', he instituted an '735'ion to rec'118' possession of '49'. Erskine '28' on '4' '173' '500'; '6' he '98' supported it by '99'ing, '7' '463' '4' gentle'128' '97' origin'34'y harpo'63'd '4' '614', '6' '97' '336' '97' '49' '692', '6' '146' by '385' of '4' '164' stress of '49' plunging viciousness, '97' at '181' ab'6''63'd '49'; '332' ab'6'on '49' he '64', so '7' '50' be'246' a loose-fish; '6' t'43''17'e '74' a subsequent gentle'128' re-harpo'63'd '49', '4' '614' '98' be'246' '7' subsequent gentle'128''s property, '549' '31' w'413'ver harpoon '240' '19' '91' '295' '856'ing in '49'.
Now in '4' '986' '390' Erskine con'606'ded '7' '4' examples of '4' whale '6' '4' '614' '85' reciproc'34'y illustrative of '356' '173'.
These pleadings, '6' '4' '893'er pleadings, '213' duly '299', '4' '131' '819'ed Judge in '451' terms '750', to wit,—That as '17' '4' boat, he a'869'ded it to '4' plaintiffs, beca'364' '69' '97' merely ab'6''63'd it to '550' '238' '349's; '33' '7' '31' regard to '4' contr'118'ted whale, harpoons, '6' '518', '69' be'192'ed to '4' def'398'ants; '4' whale, beca'364' it '28' a Loose-Fish at '4' '75' of '4' final capture; '6' '4' harpoons '6' '518' beca'364' '74' '4' fish '721'e '141' '31' '116', it ('4' fish) acqui'796' a property in '200' articles; '6' hence '138''618' '94' '180''869'ds '111'k '4' fish '97' a '40' to '116'. Now '4' def'398'ants '180''869'ds '111'k '4' fish; ergo, '4' a'17'e'136' articles '85' '238's.
A common '128' '262' at '14' '911' of '4' '131' '819'ed Judge, '240' '999' object to it. But ploughed up to '4' primary rock of '4' '301', '4' '149' '164' principles laid d'249' in '4' t'768' whaling '749's previously quoted, '6' app'596'd '6' eluci'517'd by Lord Ellenborough in '4' above cited '390'; '182' '149' '749's '678'ing Fast-Fish '6' Loose-Fish, I '99', '76', on reflection, be '295' '4' '427'da'508'tals of '34' hu'128' jurisprudence; '17' '23''31'st'6'ing '716' complicated tracery of sculpture, '4' Temple of '4' Law, '46' '4' Temple of '4' Phi'919'ines, '129' '33' '149' props to st'6' on.
Is it '23' a '99'ing in e'131' '63''s '843', Possession is '499' of '4' '749': '7' is, regard'759' of '60' '4' '124' '246' '155' possession? But of'606' possession is '4' '251' of '4' '749'. What '36' '4' si'212's '6' souls of Russian serfs '6' Republi'51' slaves '33' Fast-Fish, w'43'of possession is '4' '251' of '4' '749'? What to '4' rapacious l'6'lord is '4' widow's '181' mite '33' a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain's marble '128'sion '31' a '450'-p'399' '17' a waif; '11' is '7' '33' a Fast-Fish? What is '4' ruinous dis'893' '265' Mordecai, '4' '785'r, '42's '83' '719' Woebeg'63', '4' bankrupt, on a loan to '184' Woebeg'63''s '250' '83' starvation; '11' is '7' ruinous dis'893' '33' a Fast-Fish? What is '4' Archbishop of Savesoul's in'67' of L100,000 seized '83' '4' s'51't b'504' '6' cheese of hund'796's of thous'6's of '785'n-'78'ed laborers ('34' '115' of heaven '327' '138' of Savesoul's '148') '11' is '7' globular L100,000 '33' a Fast-Fish? What '36' '4' Duke of D'447''s '43'ditary t'249's '6' ham'123's '33' Fast-Fish? What to '7' '796'oubted harpo'63'er, '608' Bull, is '719' Irel'6', '33' a Fast-Fish? What to '7' apostolic lancer, Br'173' Jona'169', is Texas '33' a Fast-Fish? And c'336'rning '34' '182', is '23' Possession '4' '251' of '4' '749'?
But if '4' doctrine of Fast-Fish be '281' gener'34'y applic'473', '4' '207''796' doctrine of Loose-Fish is s'773' '117' widely so. That is internation'34'y '6' univers'34'y applic'473'.
What '28' America in 1492 '33' a Loose-Fish, in '265' Columbus struck '4' Spanish st'6'ard by '103' of waifing it '17' '90' royal master '6' mistress? What '28' Pol'6' to '4' Czar? What Greece to '4' Turk? What India to Engl'6'? What at '181' '76' Mexico be to '4' United States? All Loose-Fish.
What '36' '4' Rights of Man '6' '4' Liberties of '4' World '33' Loose-Fish? What '34' '508''s '241's '6' opinions '33' Loose-Fish? What is '4' principle of religious be'596'f in '116' '33' a Loose-Fish? What to '4' os'606'tatious smuggling verba'919's '36' '4' '147's of '54'ers '33' Loose-Fish? What is '4' '164' globe '716'elf '33' a Loose-Fish? And '11' '36' '1', '504'er, '33' a Loose-Fish '6' a Fast-Fish, '111'?




CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.

"De balena vero sufficit, si rex ha'942' ca'186', et regina caudam." Br'735'on, l. 3, c. 3.
Latin '83' '4' '560's of '4' Laws of Engl'6', '265' '645' '549' '31' '4' context, '410', '7' of '34' whales captu'796' by '138''618' on '4' coast of '7' l'6', '4' King, as Hon'119'ary Gr'6' Harpo'63'er, '259' '19' '4' '342', '6' '4' Queen be '952''597'y '986'ed '31' '4' tail. A division '265', in '4' whale, is '137' '46' halving an apple; t'43' is no intermediate remainder. Now as '14' '749', '447' a modified '17'm, is to '14' '183' in '17'ce in Engl'6'; '6' as it '141'ers in various '952's a st'868'ge anomaly '678'ing '4' general '749' of Fast '6' Loose-Fish, it is '43' tr'545'ed of in a separate chapter, on '4' '276' c'119'teous principle '7' prompts '4' English rail'103's to be at '4' expense of a separate '324', speci'34'y reserved '17' '4' accommodation of royalty. In '4' '171' '226', in curious proof of '4' '418' '7' '4' above-'508'ti'63'd '749' is s'773' in '17'ce, I proceed to lay '165' '1' a circumstance '7' '203' '31'in '4' '181' '149' '266'.
It '562's '7' '96' h'913't mariners of D'118', or S'6'wich, or '96' '63' of '4' Cinque Ports, '97' '180' a '321' c'129'e succeeded in '320'ing '6' b'356'ing a '178' whale '265' '69' '97' origin'34'y descried a'458' '141' '83' '4' shore. Now '4' Cinque Ports '36' '348'i'34'y or '96''60' '447' '4' jurisdiction of a '563' of '476''128' or beadle, c'34'ed a Lord Warden. H'261'ing '4' '493' directly '83' '4' cr'249', I '172', '34' '4' royal emolu'508'ts incident to '4' Cinque Port territories be'67' by as'659''508't '90'. By '96' '863'rs '14' '493' is c'34'ed a sinecure. But '23' so. Beca'364' '4' Lord Warden is busily employed at '464' in fobbing '90' perqui'421'es; '265' '36' '90' chiefly by virtue of '7' '276' fobbing of '116'.
Now '74' '182' '719' sun-burnt mariners, '960'e-footed, '6' '31' '238' trowsers rolled '530' up on '238' eely legs, '97' '854'ily hauled '238' fat fish '530' '6' dry, promising '116'selves a '68' L150 '83' '4' precious oil '6' b'63'; '6' in fantasy sipping r'36' tea '31' '238' wives, '6' '68' ale '31' '238' cronies, upon '4' strength of '238' '952'ive '904's; up '761's a '131' '819'ed '6' '344' '917'tian '6' charit'473' gentle'128', '31' a copy of Blackst'63' '447' '90' arm; '6' laying it upon '4' whale's '342', he '415'—"H'6's '141'! '14' fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as '4' Lord Warden's." Upon '14' '4' '719' mariners in '238' '952'ful consternation—so truly English—kno'768'g '23' '11' to '99', f'34' to vigorously scratching '238' '342's '34' round; '80''313' rue'597'y glancing '83' '4' whale to '4' st'868'ger. But '7' '64' in '56'ise '508'd '4' '301', or at '34' sof'606' '4' '321' '374' of '4' '819'ed gentle'128' '31' '4' copy of Blackst'63'. At length '63' of '116', '180' '192' scratching '39' '17' '90' '256's, '721'e b'261' to '613',
"Please, '284', '94' is '4' Lord Warden?"
"The Duke."
"But '4' duke '97' no'124' to do '31' '409' '14' fish?"
"It is '90'."
"We '19' '91' at '164' '461', '6' peril, '6' '96' expense, '6' is '34' '7' to go to '4' Duke's benefit; we '42'ting no'124' at '34' '17' '119' '684's '33' '119' b'919'ers?"
"It is '90'."
"Is '4' Duke so '131' '719' as to be '17'ced to '14' desperate mode of '42'ting a '349'lihood?"
"It is '90'."
"I '147' to re'596've my '261' '515'-ridden m'173' by '348' of my '904' of '14' whale."
"It is '90'."
"Won't '4' Duke be con'606't '31' a quarter or a '499'?"
"It is '90'."
In a '429', '4' whale '28' seized '6' s'261', '6' '90' '689' '4' Duke of Wellington received '4' m'63'y. Thinking '7' viewed in '96' '348'icular '703's, '4' '390' '240' by a '960'e possibility in '96' sm'34' degree be deemed, '447' '4' circumstances, a '743' '321' '63', an h'913't clergy'128' of '4' t'249' '952''597'y ad'926'ed a '23'e to '90' '689', begging '58' to '101' '4' '390' of '200' un'17'tunate mariners '155' '597' con'500'ration. To '265' my Lord Duke in substance rep'596'd ('312' '123'ters '85' publi'50'd) '7' he '97' '287' d'63' so, '6' received '4' m'63'y, '6' '72' be obliged to '4' r'167''398' gentle'128' if '17' '4' '670' he ('4' r'167''398' gentle'128') '72' dec'518' meddling '31' '173' '151''s '355'. Is '14' '4' s'773' militant '261' '128', st'6'ing at '4' corners of '4' '291' kingdoms, on '34' '524' coercing alms of beggars?

Says Plowdon, '4' whale so '808' be'192's to '4' King '6' Queen, "beca'364' of '716' superior excellence." And by '4' '602'est com'508'tators '14' '129' '167' '91' held a cogent argu'508't in '375' '301's.
But '65' '134' '4' King '19' '4' '342', '6' '4' Queen '4' tail? A '385' '17' '7', ye '977's!
In '90' tr'545'ise on "Queen-G'261'," or Queen-pinm'63'y, an '261' King's '742'ch author, '63' William Prynne, thus dis'239'th: "Ye tail is ye Queen's, '7' ye Queen's '869'drobe '289' be supp'596'd '31' ye whaleb'63'."

But '14' '276' b'63' is '23' in '4' tail; it is in '4' '342', '265' is a sad mis'101' '17' a sagacious '977' '46' Prynne. But is '4' Queen a mermaid, to be '986'ed '31' a tail?

CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The '823'-Bud.

"In vain it '28' to rake '17' Ambergriese in '4' paunch of '14' Levia'169', insuffer'473' fetor denying '23' inquiry." Sir '534' Br'249'e, V.'800'
It '28' a '532' or '149' '180' '4' '181' whaling scene re'893'ed, '6' '74' we '85' slowly sailing '118' a '503'y, vap'119'y, mid-'183' sea, '7' '4' '128'y noses on '4' Pequod's deck '831'd '117' vigilant disc'118'ers '169' '4' '291' p'769's of '495' aloft. A peculiar '6' '23' '131' pleasant smell '28' smelt in '4' sea.
"I '76' '592' so'559'hing '56'," '136' Stubb, "'7' '96'w'43' '43''39's '36' '96' of '200' drugged whales we tickled '4' '173' '183'. I '147' '69' '72' keel up '165' '192'."
Pre'708'ly, '4' vap'119's in advance slid a'500'; '6' t'43' in '4' distance lay a ship, '94'se furled sails '592'okened '7' '96' '563' of whale '259' be '549''500'. As we glided '958'er, '4' st'868'ger s'60'ed French col'119's '83' '90' peak; '6' by '4' eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl '7' circled, '6' h'118'ed, '6' swooped '187' '58', it '28' plain '7' '4' whale '549''500' '259' be '11' '4' fi'50'r'508' c'34' a b'181'ed whale, '7' is, a whale '7' '129' '474'd unmolested on '4' sea, '6' so floated an unappropriated corpse. It '289' '35' be c'336'ived, '11' an unsavory odor '375' a m'652' '259' exhale; '623' '169' an Assyrian '709' in '4' plague, '74' '4' '565' '36' incompe'606't to bury '4' de'348'ed. So '155'ler'473' indeed is it regarded by '96', '7' no cupidity '87' persuade '116' to moor '549''500' of it. Yet '36' t'43' '200' '94' '76' s'773' do it; '23''31'st'6'ing '4' '418' '7' '4' oil obtained '83' '375' subjects is of a '131' inferior quality, '6' by no '410' of '4' nature of attar-of-rose.
Coming s'773' '958'er '31' '4' expi'847' breeze, we '282' '7' '4' French'128' '97' a '347' whale '549''500'; '6' '14' '347' whale '562'ed '140' '117' of a nosegay '169' '4' '171'. In '350', it '391'ed '44' to be '63' of '200' '293'atical whales '7' '562' to dry up '6' '474' '31' a '563' of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; '568' '238' de'427'ct bo'474's al'344' '797'ly bankrupt of '138''124' '46' oil. N'167''4''759', in '4' proper '226' we sh'34' '66' '7' no kno'768'g fi'50'r'128' '76' '167' '391' up '90' nose at '375' a whale as '14', '60''167' '137' he '289' shun b'181'ed whales in general.
The Pequod '97' '56' swept so nigh to '4' st'868'ger, '7' Stubb v'969'd he recognised '90' '537'ting spade-pole entangled in '4' '518's '7' '85' k'23'ted round '4' tail of '63' of '182' whales.
"T'43''s a '281' '947'ow, '56'," he bante'847'ly laughed, st'6'ing in '4' ship's bows, "t'43''s a jackal '17' ye! I '35' k'56' '7' '182' Crappoes of French'508' '36' '33' '719' d'779's in '4' fi'50'ry; so'559'imes l'969''847' '238' boats '17' '448'ers, mis'409' '116' '17' Sperm Whale sp'44's; '89', '6' so'559'imes sailing '83' '238' port '31' '238' '330' '597' of '990'es of t'34'ow '51'dles, '6' '390's of snuffers, '17'e'66'ing '7' '34' '4' oil '69' '76' '42' '205' be '243' to dip '4' Captain's wick '155'; aye, we '34' k'56' '182' '124's; '33' '73' ye, '43''s a Crappo '7' is con'606't '31' '119' '568's, '4' drugged whale t'43', I '80'; aye, '6' is con'606't '111' '31' scraping '4' dry b'913' of '7' '173' precious fish he '129' t'43'. Poor d'779'! I '99', '962' round a hat, '96' '63', '6' '123''s '106' '58' a '986' of a '105' oil '17' '599' '828''s '997'. For '11' oil '540' '42' '83' '7' drugged whale t'43', '228' be fit to burn in a '872'; no, '23' in a condemned cell. And as '17' '4' '173' whale, '65', '82' '897' to '42' '117' oil by chopping up '6' '244'ing '44' '182' '291' masts of '119's, '169' '540' '42' '83' '7' bundle of b'913'; '463', '56' '7' I '54' of it, it '289' contain so'559'hing '736' a '68' '334' '117' '169' oil; '89', ambergris. I '683' '56' if '119' '261' '128' '129' '147' of '7'. It's '736' '244'ing. Yes, '16' '17' it;" '6' so '99'ing he '319'ed '17' '4' quarter-deck.
By '14' '75' '4' faint '769' '97' be'67' a comp'123'e '804'; so '7' whe'4'r or no, '4' Pequod '28' '56' '807'ly entrapped in '4' smell, '31' no '274' of escaping '722' by '716' breezing up '158'. Issuing '83' '4' cabin, Stubb '56' c'34'ed '90' boat's crew, '6' '732'ed '141' '17' '4' st'868'ger. Dra'768'g across '49' bow, he perceived '7' in accor'725' '31' '4' fanciful French taste, '4' upper '348' of '49' stem-'747' '28' '324'ved in '4' '46'ness of a huge drooping s'150', '28' '684'ted green, '6' '17' thorns '97' copper spikes projecting '83' it '43' '6' t'43'; '4' '251' terminating in a sym'559'rical f'261'ed bulb of a b'40' '796' col'119'. Upon '49' '342' boards, in large gilt '123'ters, he '504' "B'44'on de '823',"—'823'-'33'ton, or '823'-bud; '6' '14' '28' '4' ro'128'tic '275' of '14' aromatic ship.
Though Stubb '64' '23' '447'st'6' '4' B'44'on '348' of '4' inscription, '332' '4' '429' rose, '6' '4' bulbous '575'-'342' '186' to'42''49', sufficiently '656'ed '4' '251' to '58'.
"A wooden rose-bud, eh?" he cried '31' '90' h'6' to '90' nose, "'7' '76' do '131' '35'; '33' '60' '46' '34' cr'545'ion it smells!"
Now in '619' to '330' direct communication '31' '4' '151' on deck, he '97' to '732' round '4' bows to '4' starboard '500', '6' thus '67' '452' to '4' b'181'ed whale; '6' so '150' '118' it.
Arrived '98' at '14' spot, '31' '63' h'6' s'773' to '90' nose, he bawled—"B'44'on-de-'823', ahoy! '36' t'43' '138' of '1' B'44'on-de-'823's '7' '613' English?"
"Yes," rejoined a Guernsey-'128' '83' '4' bul'869'ks, '94' '391'ed '44' to be '4' chief-mate.
"Well, '98', my B'44'on-de-'823'-bud, '19' '1' '333' '4' W'479'e Whale?"
"What whale?"
"The W'479'e Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, '19' ye '333' '58'?
"N'167' '299' of '375' a whale. Cacha'202' Blanche! W'479'e Whale—no."
"Very '68', '98'; '68' '370' '56', '6' '82' c'34' '158' in a '294'."
Then rapidly '732'ing '78' to'869'ds '4' Pequod, '6' '66'ing Ahab leaning '118' '4' quarter-deck rail a'483' '90' report, he moulded '90' '149' '524' '155' a trumpet '6' sh'44'ed—"No, Sir! No!" Upon '265' Ahab re'789', '6' Stubb re'391'ed to '4' French'128'.
He '56' perceived '7' '4' Guernsey-'128', '94' '97' '22' '61' '155' '4' chains, '6' '28' '970' a '537'ting-spade, '97' slung '90' nose in a '563' of bag.
"What's '4' '301' '31' y'119' nose, t'43'?" '136' Stubb. "Broke it?"
"I '392' it '28' '785'n, or '7' I '64'n't '19' '138' nose at '34'!" '491'ed '4' Guernsey-'128', '94' '64' '23' '562' to relish '4' '292' he '28' at '131' '137'. "But '11' '36' '1' '956' y'119's '17'?"
"Oh, no'124'! It's a wax nose; I '19' to '330' it on. Fine '183', '594' it? Air '743' gardenny, I '134' '99'; '687' us a bunch of posies, '76' ye, B'44'on-de-'823'?"
"What in '4' d'779''s '275' do '1' '53' '43'?" roa'796' '4' Guernsey'128', f'666' '155' a sudden '962'ion.
"Oh! '184' '494'—'494'? '89', '55' '4' '429'! '65' '21' '1' pack '200' whales in '972' '313' '41' '406' at '514'? But joking a'500', '463'; do '1' k'56', '823'-bud, '7' '30' '34' non'587' '244'ing to '42' '138' oil '44' of '375' whales? As '17' '7' dried up '63', t'43', he '129'n't a gill in '90' '251' '324''390'."
"I k'56' '7' '35' '243'; '33', d'ye '66', '4' Captain '43' '205' '172' it; '14' is '90' '171' voyage; he '28' a Cologne '128'u'418'urer '165'. But '67' aboard, '6' '289'hap '540' '172' '1', if he '205' me; '6' so '82' '42' '44' of '14' dirty scrape."
"Any'124' to oblige ye, my '584' '6' pleasant '947'ow," rejoined Stubb, '6' '31' '7' he '358' mounted to '4' deck. T'43' a queer scene '986'ed '716'elf. The sailors, in t'652'elled caps of '796' '1000'ed, '85' '42'ting '4' heavy tackles in '504'iness '17' '4' whales. But '69' '176'ed '743' slow '6' '649' '131' '692', '6' '562'ed in '138''124' '33' a '68' humor. All '238' noses up'869'dly projected '83' '238' '352's '46' so '128'y jib-booms. Now '6' '98' p'769's of '116' '72' '705' '238' '176', '6' '366' up to '4' mast-'342' to '42' '96' fresh '769'. Some '54'ing '69' '72' '756' '4' plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, '6' at intervals held it to '238' nostrils. O'4'rs '305' '785'n '4' stems of '238' pipes al'344' '940' '141' at '4' bowl, '85' vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so '7' it constantly filled '238' ol'418'ories.
Stubb '28' struck by a s'60'er of '44'cries '6' ana'116'as proceeding '83' '4' Captain's round-ho'364' abaft; '6' '262' in '7' direction '282' a fiery '352' thrust '83' '528' '4' '450', '265' '28' held ajar '83' '31'in. T'90' '28' '4' tor'508'ted surgeon, '94', '180' in vain remonstrating '485' '4' proceedings of '4' '183', '97' be'645' '58''968' to '4' Captain's round-ho'364' (cabinet he c'34'ed it) to avoid '4' pest; '33' s'773', '87' '23' '148' yelling '44' '90' entr'545'ies '6' indignations at '464'.
Marking '34' '14', Stubb argued '35' '17' '90' scheme, '6' '391'ing to '4' Guernsey-'128' '97' a '105' chat '31' '58', du'847' '265' '4' st'868'ger mate expressed '90' de'704'ation of '90' Captain as a c'336'ited ignoramus, '94' '97' '561' '116' '34' '155' so unsavory '6' unprofit'473' a '512'le. Sounding '58' '324'e'597'y, Stubb fur'4'r perceived '7' '4' Guernsey-'128' '97' '23' '4' s'703'est suspicion c'336'rning '4' ambergris. He t'43''17'e held '90' peace on '7' '342', '33' '173'wise '28' '538' f'868'k '6' confidential '31' '58', so '7' '4' '149' quickly concocted a '105' '519' '17' '312' circumventing '6' satirizing '4' Captain, '327' '90' at '34' '710'ing of dis'395'ing '238' '317'rity. According to '14' '105' '519' of '238's, '4' Guernsey-'128', '447' c'118' of an interpreter's '493', '28' to '81' '4' Captain '11' he '142'd, '33' as '260' '83' Stubb; '6' as '17' Stubb, he '28' to utter '138' non'587' '7' '134' '67' upper'344' in '58' du'847' '4' interview.
By '14' '75' '238' destined victim appea'796' '83' '90' cabin. He '28' a sm'34' '6' '967', '33' '743' delicate '262' '128' '17' a sea-captain, '31' large w'90'kers '6' moustache, '60''167'; '6' wore a '796' cotton velvet vest '31' '430'-seals at '90' '500'. To '14' gentle'128', Stubb '28' '56' politely introduced by '4' Guernsey-'128', '94' at '336' os'606'tatiously '186' on '4' aspect of interpreting '592'ween '116'.
"What sh'34' I '99' to '58' '171'?" '136' he.
"Why," '136' Stubb, '784'ing '4' velvet vest '6' '4' '430' '6' seals, "'1' '289' as '35' begin by '361' '58' '7' he '388' a '563' of '231'ish to me, '463' I '21' pre'606'd to be a '993'."
"He '415', Monsieur," '136' '4' Guernsey-'128', in French, '391'ing to '90' captain, "'7' '146' '89'ter'183' '90' ship spoke a vessel, '94'se captain '6' chief-mate, '31' '578' sailors, '97' '34' '474'd of a f'167' '808' '83' a b'181'ed whale '69' '97' '561' '549''500'."
Upon '14' '4' captain '319'ed, '6' eagerly de'284'ed to k'56' '117'.
"What '56'?" '136' '4' Guernsey-'128' to Stubb.
"Why, '317' he '726' it so '454', '81' '58' '7' '56' I '19' '784'd '58' '324'e'597'y, '16' '538' '979' '7' '86' no '117' fit to com'128'd a whale-ship '169' a St. J'414' monkey. In '418', '81' '58' '83' me '86' a baboon."
"He vows '6' decl'36's, Monsieur, '7' '4' '173' whale, '4' dried '63', is '458' '117' '314'ly '169' '4' b'181'ed '63'; in '178', Monsieur, he conjures us, as we value '119' '349's, to '537' loose '83' '182' fish."
Instantly '4' captain '868' '17''869'd, '6' in a loud '915' com'128'ded '90' crew to desist '83' hoisting '4' '537'ting-tackles, '6' at '336' cast loose '4' c'473's '6' chains confining '4' whales to '4' ship.
"What '56'?" '136' '4' Guernsey-'128', '74' '4' Captain '97' re'391'ed to '116'.
"Why, '123' me '66'; '89', '1' '289' as '35' '81' '58' '56' '7'—'7'—in '418', '81' '58' '114' '64'dled '58', '6' (a'500' to '58''968') '760' '96''618' '234'."
"He '415', Monsieur, '7' '86' '131' '280' to '19' '91' of '138' serv'972' to us."
Hea'847' '14', '4' captain v'969'd '7' '69' '85' '4' grateful '348'ies ('80'ing '58''968' '6' mate) '6' concluded by inviting Stubb d'249' '155' '90' cabin to '580' a bottle of Bordeaux.
"He '53's '1' to '101' a gl'652' of '768'e '31' '58'," '136' '4' interpreter.
"Thank '58' '374'ily; '33' '81' '58' '30' '485' my principles to '580' '31' '4' '128' '114' '64'dled. In '418', '81' '58' I '259' go."
"He '415', Monsieur, '7' '90' principles '205' '774' of '90' '580'ing; '33' '7' if Monsieur '53's to '349' an'173' '183' to '580', '98' Monsieur '97' '258' '705' '34' '492' boats, '6' '732' '4' ship '170' '83' '182' whales, '17' '30' so '804' '69' '205' drift."
By '14' '75' Stubb '28' '118' '4' '500', '6' '42'ting '155' '90' boat, hailed '4' Guernsey-'128' to '14' effect,—'7' '305' a '192' tow-'518' in '90' boat, he '72' do '11' he '87' to '148' '116', by '732'ing '44' '4' '703'er whale of '4' '149' '83' '4' ship's '500'. While '4' French'128''s boats, '98', '85' engaged in to'768'g '4' ship '63' '103', Stubb benevolently t'969'd '170' at '90' whale '4' '173' '103', os'606'tatiously slacking '44' a '344' unusu'34'y '192' tow-'518'.
Pre'708'ly a breeze sp'868'g up; Stubb feigned to cast '141' '83' '4' whale; hoisting '90' boats, '4' French'128' '358' increased '90' distance, '313' '4' Pequod slid in '592'ween '58' '6' Stubb's whale. W'43'upon Stubb quickly '732'ed to '4' floating '618', '6' hailing '4' Pequod to '145' '23''972' of '90' in'606'tions, at '336' proceeded to reap '4' fruit of '90' un'40'eous cunning. Seizing '90' sharp boat-spade, he com'508'ced an excavation in '4' '618', a '105' '528' '4' '500' fin. You '72' al'344' '19' '147' he '28' digging a cellar t'43' in '4' sea; '6' '74' at length '90' spade struck '485' '4' g'976' ribs, it '28' '46' '391'ing up '261' Ro'128' tiles '6' pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat's crew '85' '34' in '530' excite'508't, eagerly '148'ing '238' chief, '6' '262' as anxious as g'261'-hunters.
And '34' '4' '75' '539''759' fowls '85' diving, '6' ducking, '6' screaming, '6' yelling, '6' '535'ing '187' '116'. Stubb '28' beginning to '73' disap'378'ed, especi'34'y as '4' horrible nosegay increased, '74' suddenly '83' '44' '4' '131' '374' of '14' plague, t'43' stole a faint stream of perfume, '265' fl'969'd '209' '4' tide of '217' smells '327' '213' absor'515' by it, as '63' river '76' flow '155' '6' '98' '549' '31' an'173', '327' at '34' bl'398'ing '31' it '17' a '75'.
"I '19' it, I '19' it," cried Stubb, '31' de'703', striking so'559'hing in '4' subter'868'ean regions, "a purse! a purse!"
Dropping '90' spade, he thrust '312' '524' in, '6' drew '44' h'6'fuls of so'559'hing '7' '720' '46' ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled '261' cheese; '131' unctuous '6' savory '31'al. You '240' easily dent it '31' y'119' thumb; it is of a hue '592'ween yellow '6' ash col'119'. And '14', '68' fri'398's, is ambergris, '736' a g'261' guinea an ounce to '138' druggist. Some '578' h'6'fuls '85' obtained; '33' '117' '28' unavoidably '387' in '4' sea, '6' s'773' '117', '760', '240' '19' '91' secu'796' '85' it '23' '17' impatient Ahab's loud com'128'd to Stubb to desist, '6' '67' on board, '234' '4' ship '72' bid '116' '68' '370'.




CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.

Now '14' ambergris is a '131' curious substance, '6' so '425' as an article of commerce, '7' in 1791 a '979' Nantucket-born Captain C'141'in '28' exa'462'd at '4' '960' of '4' English Ho'364' of Commons on '7' subject. For at '7' '75', '6' indeed '326' a comparatively '399' '183', '4' precise origin of ambergris remained, '46' amber '716'elf, a '293' to '4' '819'ed. Though '4' '429' ambergris is '33' '4' French compound '17' grey amber, '332' '4' '149' substances '36' '538' distinct. For amber, '463' at '464' '295' on '4' sea-coast, is '516' dug up in '96' '458' inl'6' soils, w'43'as ambergris is n'167' '295' '722' upon '4' sea. Be'500's, amber is a '321', t'868'sp'36'nt, brittle, odor'759' substance, '364'd '17' '843'-'747's to pipes, '17' beads '6' orna'508'ts; '33' ambergris is soft, waxy, '6' so '530'ly frag'868't '6' spicy, '7' it is largely '364'd in perfumery, in '536'iles, precious '51'dles, h'769'-powders, '6' pomatum. The Turks '364' it in cooking, '6' '516' '324'ry it to Mecca, '17' '4' '276' purpose '7' f'868'kincense is '324'ried to St. Peter's in Rome. Some '768'e merchants '705' a '360' grains '155' cl'36't, to flavor it.
Who '72' '54', '98', '7' '375' '178' la'474's '6' gentle'508' '134' regale '116'selves '31' an essence '295' in '4' inglorious b'969'ls of a '541' whale! Yet so it is. By '96', ambergris is '340' to be '4' ca'364', '6' by '173's '4' effect, of '4' dyspepsia in '4' whale. How to cure '375' a dyspepsia it '85' '321' to '99', un'759' by administe'847' '291' or '492' boat loads of Br'6'reth's pills, '6' '98' '573' '44' of harm's '103', as laborers do in b'181'ing rocks.
I '19' '17''61''606' to '99' '7' t'43' '85' '295' in '14' ambergris, '979' '321', round, bony p'399's, '265' at '171' Stubb '147' '240' be sailors' trowsers '33'tons; '33' it '180''869'ds '391'ed '44' '7' '69' '85' no'124' '117' '169' '747's of sm'34' squid b'913' embalmed in '7' '128'ner.
Now '7' '4' incorruption of '14' '344' frag'868't ambergris '134' be '295' in '4' '374' of '375' decay; is '14' no'124'? Be'54' '4'e of '7' '99'ing of St. '586' in Corinthians, '39' corruption '6' incorruption; '60' '7' we '36' s'249' in dishon'119', '33' raised in glory. And '46'wise c'34' to '241' '7' '99'ing of Paracelsus '39' '11' it is '7' '106'th '4' '258' musk. Also '353' '23' '4' st'868'ge '418' '7' of '34' '124's of ill-savor, Cologne-'604', in '716' rudi'508'tal '128'u'418'u'847' stages, is '4' '1000'.
I '134' '46' to conclude '4' chapter '31' '4' above appeal, '33' '51''23', o'768'g to my anxiety to repel a charge of'606' '721'e '485' whale'508', '6' '265', in '4' estimation of '96' '287' biased '241's, '240' be con'500''796' as indirectly substantiated by '11' '129' '91' '136' of '4' French'128''s '149' whales. Elsew'43' in '14' volume '4' sl'6'erous aspersion '129' '91' dis'831'd, '7' '4' vocation of whaling is '209''44' a slatternly, untidy '355'. But t'43' is an'173' '124' to re'33'. T'84' hint '7' '34' whales '194' smell '217'. Now '60' '64' '14' odious stigma originate?
I opine, '7' it is plainly trace'473' to '4' '171' arrival of '4' Greenl'6' whaling ships in London, '117' '169' '149' centuries '414'. Beca'364' '200' whale'508' '64' '23' '98', '6' do '23' '56', '244' '44' '238' oil at sea as '4' Sou'4'rn ships '19' '194' d'63'; '33' '537'ting up '4' fresh blubber in sm'34' b'716', thrust it '209' '4' bung holes of large c'257's, '6' '324'ry it '179' in '7' '128'ner; '4' '940'ness of '4' sea'273' in '200' Icy Seas, '6' '4' sudden '6' violent storms to '265' '69' '36' exposed, '17'bidding '138' '173' '239'. The consequence is, '7' upon '448'ing '155' '4' '330', '6' unloading '63' of '182' whale ce'559'eries, in '4' Greenl'6' dock, a savor is '145'n '17'th '96''11' similar to '7' arising '83' excavating an '261' '709' grave-yard, '17' '4' '295'ations of a Lying-in-Hospital.
I '348'ly surmise '516', '7' '14' wicked charge '485' whalers '289' be '46'wise im'186'ed to '4' exis'606'ce on '4' coast of Greenl'6', in '17'mer '464', of a Dutch village c'34'ed Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, '265' latter '275' is '4' '63' '364'd by '4' '819'ed Fogo Von Slack, in '90' '164' '176' on Smells, a text-'560' on '7' subject. As '716' '275' imports (smeer, fat; berg, to '186' up), '14' village '28' '295'ed in '619' to af'17'd a '226' '17' '4' blubber of '4' Dutch whale fleet to be '457' '44', '327' '213' '645' '179' to Holl'6' '17' '7' purpose. It '28' a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, '6' oil '50'ds; '6' '74' '4' '176's '85' in '597' operation '658' '417' '17'th no '131' pleasant savor. But '34' '14' is '538' '465' '31' a S'44'h Sea Sperm Whaler; '265' in a voyage of '492' '266' '760', '180' comp'123'ely filling '49' '330' '31' oil, '185' '23', '760', consume fifty '433' in '4' '355' of boiling '44'; '6' in '4' '892' '7' it is c'257'ed, '4' oil is '958'ly scent'759'. The '350' is, '7' '565' or '314', if '33' decently tr'545'ed, whales as a species '36' by no '410' cr'545'ures of ill odor; nor '51' whale'508' be recognised, as '4' '151' of '4' '845' ages affected to detect a Jew in '4' '624', by '4' nose. Nor indeed '51' '4' whale '999' be '173'wise '169' frag'868't, '74', as a general '124', he '932's '375' '530' health; '409' abun'725' of exercise; '194' '44' of '450's; '463', it is '354', seldom in '4' '422' '769'. I '99', '7' '4' motion of a Sperm Whale's flukes above '604' dispenses a perfume, as '74' a musk-scented '614' rustles '49' '926' in a '869'm parlor. What '98' sh'34' I '46'n '4' Sperm Whale to '17' frag'868'ce, con'500''847' '90' magnitude? Must it '23' be to '7' famous elephant, '31' je'35'ed tusks, '6' '796'olent '31' myrrh, '265' '28' led '44' of an Indian t'249' to do hon'119' to Alex'6'er '4' Gr'545'?




CHAPTER 93. The Cast'170'.

It '28' '33' '96' '360' '433' '180' en'893'e'847' '4' French'128', '7' a '344' '659'ifi'51't '140't be'947' '4' '344' in'659'ifi'51't of '4' Pequod's crew; an '140't '344' la'508't'473'; '6' '265' '398'ed in providing '4' so'559'imes '721'ly merry '6' p'796'estinated craft '31' a '565' '6' '167' ac'624'ing prophecy of w'413'ver shatte'796' sequel '240' '831' '49' '249'.
Now, in '4' whale ship, it is '23' e'131' '63' '7' '547' in '4' boats. Some '360' '524' '36' reserved c'34'ed ship-'184'ers, '94'se province it is to '176' '4' vessel '313' '4' boats '36' pursuing '4' whale. As a general '124', '182' ship-'184'ers '36' as '321'y '947'ows as '4' '508' comprising '4' boats' crews. But if t'43' '308' to be an unduly sl'398'er, clumsy, or timorous wight in '4' ship, '7' wight is '979' to be '721'e a ship-'184'er. It '28' so in '4' Pequod '31' '4' '105' negro Pippin by nick-'275', Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye '19' '299' of '58' '165'; ye '259' '219' '90' tamb'119'ine on '7' dramatic mid'168', so gloomy-jolly.
In '44'er aspect, Pip '6' Dough-Boy '721'e a match, '46' a '751' pony '6' a '691' '63', of equal develop'508'ts, '463' of dissimilar col'119', '698'n in '63' eccentric span. But '313' hap'759' Dough-Boy '28' by nature dull '6' torpid in '90' in'81'ects, Pip, '463' '118' '606'der-'374'ed, '28' at bottom '131' b'40', '31' '7' pleasant, genial, jolly b'40'ness peculiar to '90' tribe; a tribe, '265' '167' '932' '34' holi'433' '6' festivities '31' '178'r, '523'r relish '169' '138' '173' race. For '751's, '4' '407''s cal'398'ar '134' s'60' naught '33' '291' hund'796' '6' '578'ty-'401' F'119'th of Julys '6' New Year's Days. Nor smile so, '313' I '863' '7' '14' '105' '751' '28' brilliant, '17' '140' '751'ness '129' '716' brilliancy; be'330' yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king's cabinets. But Pip '112'd '139', '6' '34' '139''s peace'473' securities; so '7' '4' panic-striking '355' in '265' he '97' '96''60' unac'893'ably be'67' entrapped, '97' '344' sadly blur'796' '90' b'40'ness; '463', as ere '192' '76' be '333', '11' '28' thus temporarily subdued in '58', in '4' '398' '28' destined to be luridly illu'462'd by st'868'ge wild '522's, '7' fictitiously s'60'ed '58' '141' to '606' '464' '4' natural lustre '31' '265' in '90' native Toll'6' County in Connecti'537', he '97' '336' en'349'ned '128'y a fiddler's frolic on '4' green; '6' at melodious '140'-tide, '31' '90' gay ha-ha! '97' '391'ed '4' round horizon '155' '63' star-belled tamb'119'ine. So, '463' in '4' '574' '769' of '183', susp'398'ed '485' a blue-veined neck, '4' pure-'604'ed diamond '705' '76' healthful glow; '332', '74' '4' cunning je'35'er '72' s'60' '1' '4' diamond in '716' '344' impressive lustre, he lays it '485' a gloomy ground, '6' '98' '703's it up, '23' by '4' sun, '33' by '96' unnatural gases. Then '67' '44' '200' fiery effulgences, infern'34'y superb; '98' '4' '779'-blazing diamond, '336' '4' divinest symbol of '4' crystal skies, '388' '46' '96' cr'249'-jewel stolen '83' '4' King of Hell. But '123' us to '4' '480'.
It '246' to '962', '7' in '4' ambergris af'807' Stubb's '180'-oars'128' '365'd so to sprain '90' h'6', as '17' a '75' to be'67' '538' maimed; '6', temporarily, Pip '28' '186' '155' '90' '226'.
The '171' '75' Stubb l'969''796' '31' '58', Pip evinced '137' nervousness; '33' happily, '17' '7' '75', escaped '452' cont'735' '31' '4' whale; '6' t'43''17'e '246' '141' '23' alto'42''49' disc'796'itably; '463' Stubb observing '58', '111'k '324'e, '180''869'ds, to exhort '58' to c'49'ish '90' c'119'ageousness to '4' ut'344', '17' he '240' of'606' '156' it '107'ful.
Now upon '4' '347' l'969''847', '4' boat paddled upon '4' whale; '6' as '4' fish received '4' darted iron, it '417' '716' customary rap, '265' '203', in '14' instance, to be '40' '447' '719' Pip's s'545'. The involuntary consternation of '4' mo'508't ca'364'd '58' to leap, paddle in h'6', '44' of '4' boat; '6' in '375' a '103', '7' '348' of '4' slack whale '518' '260' '485' '90' chest, he breasted it '118'board '31' '58', so as to be'67' entangled in it, '74' at '181' plumping '155' '4' '604'. That instant '4' stricken whale '319'ed on a fierce '366', '4' '518' swiftly straigh'606'ed; '6' p'426'o! '719' Pip '246' '34' foaming up to '4' chocks of '4' boat, remorse'759'ly dragged t'43' by '4' '518', '265' '97' '645' s'167'al '391's '187' '90' chest '6' neck.
Tashtego s'111'd in '4' bows. He '28' '597' of '4' '522' of '4' hunt. He '413'd Pip '17' a poltroon. Snatching '4' boat-knife '83' '716' '50'ath, he susp'398'ed '716' sharp edge '118' '4' '518', '6' '391'ing to'869'ds Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, "Cut?" Mean'75' Pip's blue, choked '352' plainly '720', Do, '17' God's '997'! All '962'ed in a flash. In '759' '169' '499' a '294', '14' '797' '124' '203'.
"Damn '58', '537'!" roa'796' Stubb; '6' so '4' whale '28' '387' '6' Pip '28' '550'd.
So '358' as he rec'118'ed '58''968', '4' '719' '105' negro '28' '652'ailed by yells '6' execrations '83' '4' crew. T'868'quilly permitting '182' irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb '98' in a plain, '355'-'46', '33' s'773' '499' humorous '128'ner, cursed Pip '141'ici'34'y; '6' '7' d'63', un'141'ici'34'y '417' '58' '137' '251''96' adv'972'. The substance '28', N'167' jump '83' a boat, Pip, '722'—'33' '34' '4' '426' '28' indefinite, as '4' '602'est adv'972' '167' is. Now, in general, Stick to '4' boat, is y'119' '354' motto in whaling; '33' '390's '76' so'559'imes '308' '74' Leap '83' '4' boat, is s'773' '166'. More'118', as if perceiving at '181' '7' if he '134' '145' undiluted conscientious adv'972' to Pip, he '72' be '568' '58' '111' wide a margin to jump in '17' '4' '670'; Stubb suddenly '705'ped '34' adv'972', '6' concluded '31' a peremptory com'128'd, "Stick to '4' boat, Pip, or by '4' Lord, I '205' '512' '1' up if '1' jump; '241' '7'. We '51''t af'17'd to '521' whales by '4' '46's of '1'; a whale '72' sell '17' thirty '464' '11' '1' '72', Pip, in Alabama. Bear '7' in '241', '6' '21' jump '138' '117'." Hereby '760' Stubb indirectly hinted, '7' '463' '128' '112'd '90' '947'ow, '332' '128' is a m'63'y-'380' animal, '265' pr'422''421'y '111' of'606' interferes '31' '90' benevolence.
But we '36' '34' in '4' '524' of '4' Gods; '6' Pip jumped '158'. It '28' '447' '131' similar circumstances to '4' '171' per'17''128'ce; '33' '14' '75' he '64' '23' breast '44' '4' '518'; '6' hence, '74' '4' whale '319'ed to '366', Pip '28' '269' '528' on '4' sea, '46' a hurried traveller's t'366'k. Alas! Stubb '28' '33' '111' '354' to '90' '429'. It '28' a '416', bounteous, blue '183'; '4' spangled sea '804' '6' '494', '6' flatly stretching '170', '34' round, to '4' horizon, '46' g'261'-'942'er's skin hamme'796' '44' to '4' extremest. Bobbing up '6' d'249' in '7' sea, Pip's ebon '342' s'60'ed '46' a '342' of c'112's. No boat-knife '28' lifted '74' he '947' so rapidly astern. Stubb's inexor'473' '78' '28' '391'ed upon '58'; '6' '4' whale '28' '768'ged. In '291' '294's, a '251' mile of shore'759' ocean '28' '592'ween Pip '6' Stubb. Out '83' '4' centre of '4' sea, '719' Pip '391'ed '90' crisp, curling, '751' '342' to '4' sun, an'173' l'63'ly cast'170', '463' '4' loftiest '6' '4' b'40'est.
Now, in '804' wea'4'r, to swim in '4' '422' ocean is as '454' to '4' pr'735'ised swimmer as to '852' in a sp'847'-'324'riage ashore. But '4' awful l'913'o'508'ess is '155'ler'473'. The in'606'se c'336'ntration of '968' in '4' '845' of '375' a '374''759' im'508''421'y, my God! '94' '51' '81' it? Mark, '60' '74' sailors in a '314' '804' ba'4' in '4' '422' sea—mark '60' '452'ly '69' hug '238' ship '6' '146' coast '549' '49' '500's.
But '97' Stubb re'34'y ab'6''63'd '4' '719' '105' negro to '90' fate? No; he '64' '23' '80' to, at '402'. Beca'364' t'43' '85' '149' boats in '90' '830', '6' he '340', no doubt, '7' '69' '72' of '239' '67' up to Pip '131' quickly, '6' '512' '58' up; '463', indeed, '375' con'500'rations to'869'ds oars'508' jeopardized '209' '238' '249' timidity, is '23' '194' '128'ifested by '4' hunters in '34' similar instances; '6' '375' instances '23' unfrequently occur; al'344' invariably in '4' fi'50'ry, a co'869'd, so c'34'ed, is marked '31' '4' '276' ruth'759' de'704'ation peculiar to military navies '6' armies.
But it so '203', '7' '200' boats, '327' '66'ing Pip, suddenly spying whales '452' to '116' on '63' '500', '391'ed, '6' '417' c'129'e; '6' Stubb's boat '28' '56' so '458' '170', '6' he '6' '34' '90' crew so in'606't upon '90' fish, '7' Pip's '847'ed horizon began to exp'6' '187' '58' miserably. By '4' me'426' '365' '4' ship '716'elf at '181' rescued '58'; '33' '83' '7' '612' '4' '105' negro '277' '39' '4' deck an idiot; '375', at '402', '69' '136' he '28'. The sea '97' jee'847'ly '764' '90' finite '618' up, '33' dr'249'ed '4' infinite of '90' soul. Not dr'249'ed '797'ly, '463'. Ra'4'r '324'ried d'249' a'349' to wondrous depths, w'43' st'868'ge shapes of '4' un'869'ped primal '296' glided to '6' fro '165' '90' '962'ive '495'; '6' '4' miser-mer'128', Wisdom, revealed '90' hoarded heaps; '6' among '4' jo'1's, '374''759', '167'-juvenile eternities, Pip '282' '4' multitudinous, God-omni'986', coral insects, '7' '44' of '4' firma'508't of '604's heaved '4' colossal orbs. He '282' God's foot upon '4' t'504'le of '4' loom, '6' spoke it; '6' t'43''17'e '90' shipmates c'34'ed '58' '721'. So '128''s insanity is heaven's '587'; '6' w'6'e'847' '83' '34' mortal '385', '128' '67's at '181' to '7' celestial '147', '265', to '385', is absurd '6' f'868'tic; '6' weal or woe, '174's '98' uncom'449'd, in'465' as '90' God.
For '4' '426', '810' '23' Stubb '111' '321'ly. The '124' is common in '7' fi'50'ry; '6' in '4' sequel of '4' narrative, it '76' '98' be '333' '11' '46' ab'6'on'508't be'947' '302'.




CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of '4' H'6'.

That whale of Stubb's, so d'865' purc'129'ed, '28' duly '561' to '4' Pequod's '500', w'43' '34' '200' '537'ting '6' hoisting operations previously detailed, '85' regularly g'63' '209', '140' to '4' baling of '4' Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
While '96' '85' occupied '31' '14' latter duty, '173's '85' employed in dragging '170' '4' larger tubs, so '358' as filled '31' '4' sperm; '6' '74' '4' proper '75' arrived, '14' '276' sperm '28' '324'e'597'y '128'ipu'399'd ere '45' to '4' '244'-'176's, of '265' anon.
It '97' '494'ed '6' cryst'34'ized to '375' a degree, '7' '74', '31' s'167'al '173's, I sat d'249' '165' a large Constantine's bath of it, I '295' it st'868'gely concreted '155' lumps, '43' '6' t'43' rolling '39' in '4' liquid '348'. It '28' '119' '355' to squeeze '182' lumps '78' '155' fluid. A '584' '6' unctuous duty! No '683' '7' in '261' '464' '14' sperm '28' '375' a fav'119'ite cos'559'ic. Such a '574'er! '375' a swee'606'er! '375' a sof'606'er! '375' a delicious molifier! After '305' my '524' in it '17' '146' a '360' '294's, my fingers '577' '46' eels, '6' began, as it '85', to serpentine '6' spiralise.
As I sat t'43' at my ease, cross-legged on '4' deck; '180' '4' '437'ter exertion at '4' '768'dl'652'; '447' a blue t'868'quil sky; '4' ship '447' indolent sail, '6' gliding so serenely '549'; as I ba'4'd my '524' among '200' soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven al'344' '31'in '4' '612'; as '69' richly '785' to my fingers, '6' discharged '34' '238' opulence, '46' '597'y ripe grapes '238' '768'e; as I snuffed up '7' uncontaminated aroma,—liter'34'y '6' truly, '46' '4' smell of sp'847' vio'123's; I decl'36' to '1', '7' '17' '4' '75' I '349'd as in a musky meadow; I '17''61' '34' '39' '119' horrible oath; in '7' inexpressible sperm, I wa'50'd my '524' '6' my '374' of it; I al'344' began to c'796'it '4' '261' Paracelsan superstition '7' sperm is of r'36' virtue in '34'aying '4' h'545' of anger; '313' ba'124' in '7' bath, I '577' divinely '523' '83' '34' ill-'76', or petulance, or mal'972', of '138' '563' '11'so'167'.
Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! '34' '4' '339' '192'; I squeezed '7' sperm '773' I '302' al'344' melted '155' it; I squeezed '7' sperm '773' a st'868'ge '563' of insanity '246' '118' me; '6' I '295' '302' unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' '524' in it, mis'409' '238' '524' '17' '4' gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, fri'398'ly, loving '174'ing '64' '14' avocation be'42'; '7' at '181' I '28' continu'34'y squeezing '238' '524', '6' '262' up '155' '238' '495' '708'i'508't'34'y; as '137' as to '99',—Oh! my '599' '947'ow '213's, '65' '134' we '192'er c'49'ish '138' social acer'437'ies, or k'56' '4' s'703'est ill-humor or envy! Come; '123' us squeeze '524' '34' round; nay, '123' us '34' squeeze '119'selves '155' '356' '173'; '123' us squeeze '119'selves univers'34'y '155' '4' '131' milk '6' sperm of '207'ness.
Would '7' I '87' '184' squeezing '7' sperm '17' '167'! For '56', '317' by '128'y pro'192'ed, rep'545'ed experiences, I '19' perceived '7' in '34' '390's '128' '259' '140'tu'34'y l'969'r, or at '402' shift, '90' c'336'it of attain'473' feli'709'; '23' placing it '138'w'43' in '4' in'81'ect or '4' fancy; '33' in '4' '362', '4' '374', '4' '515', '4' t'473', '4' saddle, '4' '522''500', '4' '893'ry; '56' '7' I '19' perceived '34' '14', I am '325' to squeeze '390' etern'34'y. In '147's of '4' visions of '4' '168', I '282' '192' rows of angels in paradise, '356' '31' '90' '524' in a jar of spermaceti.
Now, '313' disc'119'sing of sperm, it behooves to '613' of '173' '124's akin to it, in '4' '355' of prepa'847' '4' sperm whale '17' '4' '244'-'176's.
First '67's '691'-horse, so c'34'ed, '265' is obtained '83' '4' '890''847' '348' of '4' fish, '6' '516' '83' '4' thicker portions of '90' flukes. It is '889' '31' congealed '606'dons—a wad of muscle—'33' s'773' contains '96' oil. After '213' s'167'ed '83' '4' whale, '4' '691'-horse is '171' '537' '155' port'473' ob'192's ere '45' to '4' mincer. T'84' '73' '137' '46' blocks of Berkshire marble.
Plum-pudding is '4' term '258''969'd upon '979' frag'508'tary '348's of '4' whale's flesh, '43' '6' t'43' adhe'847' to '4' blanket of blubber, '6' of'606' '348'icipating to a con'500'r'473' degree in '716' unctuousness. It is a '344' refreshing, convivial, '416' object to be'330'. As '716' '275' imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, '31' a '258'reaked s'56'y '6' g'261'en ground, dotted '31' spots of '4' deepest crim'273' '6' purple. It is plums of rubies, in '648's of citron. Spite of '385', it is '321' to '184' y'119''968' '83' '545'ing it. I confess, '7' '336' I stole '528' '4' '17'emast to '244' it. It tasted so'559'hing as I '134' c'336'ive a royal '537''123' '83' '4' t'530' of Louis le Gros '240' '19' tasted, supposing '58' to '19' '91' '466' '4' '171' '183' '180' '4' veni'273' sea'273', '6' '7' '348'icular veni'273' sea'273' contemporary '31' an unusu'34'y '178' vintage of '4' vineyards of Champagne.
T'43' is an'173' substance, '6' a '131' singular '63', '265' '391's up in '4' '239' of '14' '355', '33' '265' I '174' it to be '131' puzzling adequately to describe. It is c'34'ed slobgollion; an appellation original '31' '4' whale'508', '6' '140' so is '4' nature of '4' substance. It is an ineffably oozy, st'847'y af'807', '344' frequently '295' in '4' tubs of sperm, '180' a pro'192'ed squeezing, '6' subsequent de'51'ting. I '330' it to be '4' wondrously thin, ruptu'796' memb'868'es of '4' '390', coalescing.
Gurry, so c'34'ed, is a term properly be'192'ing to '40' whale'508', '33' so'559'imes incident'34'y '364'd by '4' sperm fi'50'r'508'. It de'659'ates '4' '967', glutinous substance '265' is scraped '141' '4' '78' of '4' Greenl'6' or '40' whale, '6' '137' of '265' c'118's '4' decks of '200' inferior souls '94' hunt '7' ignoble Levia'169'.
Nippers. Strictly '14' '429' is '23' indigenous to '4' whale's vocabulary. But as app'596'd by whale'508', it be'67's so. A whale'128''s nipper is a '940' firm s'798' of '606'dinous '343' '537' '83' '4' '890''847' '348' of Levia'169''s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, '6' '17' '4' '426', is '39' '4' size of '4' iron '348' of a hoe. Edgewise '367'd '549' '4' oily deck, it operates '46' a lea'4'rn squilgee; '6' by '275''759' bl'6'ish'508'ts, as of magic, '34'ures '549' '31' it '34' impurities.
But to '819' '34' '39' '182' recondite '301's, y'119' '258' '103' is at '336' to desc'398' '155' '4' blubber-'267', '6' '19' a '192' '150' '31' '716' inmates. T'90' '226' '129' previously '91' '508'ti'63'd as '4' receptacle '17' '4' blanket-'747's, '74' s'798't '6' hoisted '83' '4' whale. When '4' proper '75' arrives '17' '537'ting up '716' con'606'ts, '14' '814' is a scene of terror to '34' tyros, especi'34'y by '168'. On '63' '500', lit by a dull lantern, a space '129' '91' '269' '574' '17' '4' '176''508'. T'84' gener'34'y go in p'769's,—a pike-'6'-gaff'128' '6' a spade-'128'. The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of '4' '276' '275'. The gaff is so'559'hing '46' a boat-hook. With '90' gaff, '4' gaff'128' hooks on to a '50'et of blubber, '6' strives to '330' it '83' slipping, as '4' ship pitches '6' lurches '39'. Mean'313', '4' spade-'128' st'6's on '4' '50'et '716'elf, perp'398'icularly chopping it '155' '4' port'473' horse-'747's. T'90' spade is sharp as h'63' '51' '106' it; '4' spade'128''s '908' '36' shoe'759'; '4' '124' he st'6's on '76' so'559'imes irresistibly slide '170' '83' '58', '46' a sledge. If he '537's '141' '63' of '90' '249' toes, or '63' of '90' '652'istants', '72' '1' be '131' '137' astoni'50'd? Toes '36' s'324'ce among vete'868' blubber-'267' '508'.




CHAPTER 95. The C'652'ock.

Had '1' '761'ped on board '4' Pequod at a '979' juncture of '14' post-mortemizing of '4' whale; '6' '97' '1' strolled '17''869'd nigh '4' '768'dl'652', '281' '115' am I '7' '1' '72' '19' s'51'ned '31' no sm'34' curio'421'y a '131' st'868'ge, enigmatical object, '265' '1' '72' '19' '333' t'43', '666' '549' lengthwise in '4' lee scuppers. Not '4' wondrous cistern in '4' whale's huge '342'; '23' '4' prodigy of '90' unhinged l'969'r jaw; '23' '4' miracle of '90' sym'559'rical tail; '697' of '182' '72' so '715' '1', as '499' a glimpse of '7' unac'893''473' c'63',—'192'er '169' a Kentuckian is t'34', nigh a foot in dia'559'er at '4' base, '6' jet-'751' as Yojo, '4' ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is; or, '743', in '261' '464', '716' '46'ness '28'. Such an idol as '7' '295' in '4' '669' groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; '6' '17' worshipping '265', King Asa, '49' '273', '64' depose '49', '6' destroyed '4' idol, '6' burnt it '17' an abomination at '4' brook Kedron, as '967'ly '451' '17'th in '4' 15th chapter of '4' First Book of Kings.
Look at '4' sailor, c'34'ed '4' mincer, '94' '56' '67's '549', '6' '652'isted by '149' '34'ies, heavily '78's '4' gr'6'issimus, as '4' mariners c'34' it, '6' '31' b'969'd '134'ers, staggers '141' '31' it as if he '85' a grena'474'r '324'rying a '314' comrade '83' '4' field. Ex'606'ding it upon '4' '17'ecastle deck, he '56' proceeds cylindric'34'y to re'367' '716' '967' pelt, as an Afri'51' hunter '4' pelt of a boa. T'90' d'63' he '391's '4' pelt in'500' '44', '46' a pantaloon leg; '145's it a '68' stretching, so as al'344' to double '716' dia'559'er; '6' at '181' '621's it, '35' sp'504', in '4' rigging, to dry. Ere '192', it is '645' d'249'; '74' re'772' '96' '291' '908' of it, to'869'ds '4' '378'ed extremity, '6' '98' '537'ting '149' sl'716' '17' arm-holes at '4' '173' '398', he lengthwise slips '58''968' bodily '155' it. The mincer '56' st'6's '165' '1' invested in '4' '597' '51'onicals of '90' c'34'ing. Immemorial to '34' '90' '619', '14' investiture al'63' '76' adequately '711' '58', '313' employed in '4' peculiar '427'ctions of '90' '493'.
That '493' consists in mincing '4' horse-'747's of blubber '17' '4' pots; an operation '265' is conducted at a curious wooden horse, '519'ted '398'wise '485' '4' bul'869'ks, '6' '31' a capacious tub ben'545'h it, '155' '265' '4' minced '747's '705', '692' as '4' '50'ets '83' a rapt orator's desk. Arrayed in decent '751'; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; in'606't on bible '224's; '11' a '51''64'ate '17' an archbishopric, '11' a lad '17' a Pope '85' '14' mincer!*
*Bible '224's! Bible '224's! T'90' is '4' invari'473' cry '83' '4' mates to '4' mincer. It enjoins '58' to be '324'eful, '6' '537' '90' '176' '155' as thin sl'972's as '622', inas'137' as by so '143' '4' '355' of boiling '44' '4' oil is '137' accelerated, '6' '716' quantity con'500'rably increased, be'500's '760' improving it in quality.




CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.

Be'500's '49' hoisted boats, an Ameri'51' whaler is '44''869'dly distingui'50'd by '49' '244'-'176's. She '986's '4' curious anomaly of '4' '344' solid ma'273'ry joining '31' oak '6' hemp in constituting '4' comp'123'ed ship. It is as if '83' '4' '422' field a brick-kiln '85' t'868'sported to '49' '519'ks.
The '244'-'176's '36' '519'ted '592'ween '4' '17'emast '6' mainmast, '4' '344' '267'y '348' of '4' deck. The timbers ben'545'h '36' of a peculiar strength, fitted to sustain '4' w'879' of an al'344' solid m'652' of brick '6' mortar, '96' '606' '908' by '879' squ'36', '6' '401' in h'879'. The '295'ation '185' '23' penetrate '4' deck, '33' '4' ma'273'ry is firmly secu'796' to '4' sur'352' by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on '34' '500's, '6' scre'768'g it d'249' to '4' timbers. On '4' flanks it is '390'd '31' wood, '6' at '739' comp'123'ely c'118'ed by a large, sloping, bat'606'ed hatch'103'. Re'772' '14' hatch we expose '4' '164' '244'-pots, '149' in '539', '6' '356' of s'167'al '960'rels' capa'709'. When '23' in '364', '69' '36' '764' remarkably '817'. So'559'imes '69' '36' poli'50'd '31' soapst'63' '6' s'6', '773' '69' shine '31'in '46' silver punch-bowls. Du'847' '4' '168'-'430'es '96' cynical '261' sailors '76' crawl '155' '116' '6' coil '116'selves '170' t'43' '17' a nap. While employed in polishing '116'—'63' '128' in '356' pot, '500' by '500'—'128'y confidential communications '36' '324'ried on, '118' '4' iron lips. It is a '226' '516' '17' pro'295' ma'116'atical meditation. It '28' in '4' '269' h'6' '244'-pot of '4' Pequod, '31' '4' soapst'63' diligently circling round me, '7' I '28' '171' indirectly struck by '4' remark'473' '418', '7' in geo'559'ry '34' bo'474's gliding '549' '4' cycloid, my soapst'63' '17' example, '76' desc'398' '83' '138' '378' in precisely '4' '276' '75'.
Re'772' '4' '522'-board '83' '4' '569' of '4' '244'-'176's, '4' '960'e ma'273'ry of '7' '500' is exposed, penetrated by '4' '149' iron '843's of '4' furnaces, directly '447'n'545'h '4' pots. These '843's '36' fitted '31' heavy '450's of iron. The in'606'se h'545' of '4' '522' is pr'140'ted '83' communicating '716'elf to '4' deck, by '410' of a sh'34'ow reservoir ex'606'ding '447' '4' '797' in'452'd sur'352' of '4' '176's. By a tunnel inserted at '4' rear, '14' reservoir is '764' repleni'50'd '31' '604' as '692' as it evaporates. T'43' '36' no external c'58'neys; '69' '422' direct '83' '4' rear w'34'. And '43' '123' us go '78' '17' a mo'508't.
It '28' '39' nine o'clock at '168' '7' '4' Pequod's '244'-'176's '85' '171' '319'ed on '14' '986' voyage. It be'192'ed to Stubb to '118''66' '4' '355'.
"All '325' t'43'? Off hatch, '98', '6' '319' '49'. You cook, '522' '4' '176's." T'90' '28' an '454' '124', '17' '4' '324'penter '97' '91' thrusting '90' s'305's '155' '4' furnace '209''44' '4' '962'age. Here be it '136' '7' in a whaling voyage '4' '171' '522' in '4' '244'-'176's '129' to be fed '17' a '75' '31' wood. After '7' no wood is '364'd, '722' as a '410' of quick ignition to '4' staple fuel. In a '429', '180' '213' '457' '44', '4' crisp, shrivelled blubber, '56' c'34'ed scraps or fritters, s'773' contains con'500'r'473' of '716' unctuous properties. These fritters feed '4' flames. Like a p'123'horic burning martyr, or a '968'-consuming misanthrope, '336' ignited, '4' whale supp'596's '90' '249' fuel '6' burns by '90' '249' '618'. Would '7' he consumed '90' '249' smoke! '17' '90' smoke is horrible to inhale, '6' inhale it '1' '259', '6' '23' '146' '7', '33' '1' '259' '349' in it '17' '4' '75'. It '129' an un'613''473', wild, Hindoo odor '39' it, '375' as '289' lurk in '4' vicinity of '427'e'272' pyres. It smells '46' '4' '269' '768'g of '4' '183' of judg'508't; it is an argu'508't '17' '4' pit.
By mid'168' '4' '176's '85' in '597' operation. We '85' '574' '83' '4' '324''390'; sail '97' '91' '721'e; '4' '768'd '28' fre'50'ning; '4' wild ocean '967'ness '28' in'606'se. But '7' '967'ness '28' licked up by '4' fierce flames, '265' at intervals '17'ked '17'th '83' '4' sooty flues, '6' illuminated e'131' lofty rope in '4' rigging, as '31' '4' famed Greek '522'. The burning ship drove on, as if remorse'759'ly com'376'i'63'd to '96' vengeful deed. So '4' pitch '6' sulphur-fr'879'ed brigs of '4' b'261' Hydriote, Canaris, issuing '83' '238' mid'168' harbors, '31' b'937' '50'ets of flame '17' sails, bore d'249' upon '4' Turkish frigates, '6' f'261'ed '116' in conflagrations.
The hatch, re'367'd '83' '4' '739' of '4' '176's, '56' af'17'ded a wide '374'h in '569' of '116'. St'6'ing on '14' '85' '4' Tart'36'an shapes of '4' pagan harpo'63'ers, '194' '4' whale-ship's stokers. With huge pronged poles '69' pitched '90'sing m'652'es of blubber '155' '4' scalding pots, or stir'796' up '4' '522's ben'545'h, '773' '4' snaky flames darted, curling, '44' of '4' '450's to '756' '116' by '4' '908'. The smoke rolled '170' in sullen heaps. To e'131' pitch of '4' ship t'43' '28' a pitch of '4' boiling oil, '265' '562'ed '34' eagerness to leap '155' '238' '352's. Oppo'421'e '4' '843' of '4' '176's, on '4' fur'4'r '500' of '4' wide wooden '374'h, '28' '4' '768'dl'652'. T'90' served '17' a sea-sofa. Here lounged '4' '430', '74' '23' '173'wise employed, '262' '155' '4' '796' h'545' of '4' '522', '773' '238' '495' '577' scorched in '238' '342's. Their tawny f'545'ures, '56' '34' begrimed '31' smoke '6' sw'545', '238' matted beards, '6' '4' contrasting '960''960'ic brilliancy of '238' teeth, '34' '182' '85' st'868'gely revealed in '4' capricious emblazonings of '4' '176's. As '69' narrated to '356' '173' '238' unholy adventures, '238' tales of terror '163' in '429's of mirth; as '238' uncivilized laughter '17'ked up'869'ds '44' of '116', '46' '4' flames '83' '4' furnace; as to '6' fro, in '238' '569', '4' harpo'63'ers wildly gesticu'399'd '31' '238' huge pronged '17'ks '6' dippers; as '4' '768'd '60'led on, '6' '4' sea leaped, '6' '4' ship groaned '6' dived, '6' '332' stead'692'ly s'576' '49' '796' '245' fur'4'r '6' fur'4'r '155' '4' '751'ness of '4' sea '6' '4' '168', '6' scorn'597'y champed '4' '691' b'63' in '49' '843', '6' viciously spat round '49' on '34' '500's; '98' '4' rushing Pequod, fr'879'ed '31' savages, '6' laden '31' '522', '6' burning a corpse, '6' plunging '155' '7' '751'ness of '967'ness, '562'ed '4' material '893'er'348' of '49' mono'128'iac com'128'der's soul.
So '562'ed it to me, as I s'111'd at '49' helm, '6' '17' '192' '520' silently guided '4' '103' of '14' '522'-ship on '4' sea. Wrapped, '17' '7' interval, in '967'ness '302', I '33' '4' '166' '282' '4' '796'ness, '4' '721'ness, '4' g'129't'518'ss of '173's. The continual sight of '4' fi'398' shapes '165' me, cape'847' '499' in smoke '6' '499' in '522', '182' at '181' begat '207''796' visions in my soul, so '358' as I began to yield to '7' unac'893''473' drowsiness '265' '167' '72' '67' '118' me at a mid'168' helm.
But '7' '168', in '348'icular, a st'868'ge ('6' '167' '317' inexplic'473') '124' occur'796' to me. Starting '83' a brief st'6'ing '503', I '28' horribly conscious of so'559'hing fat'34'y '208'. The jaw-b'63' '773'er smote my '500', '265' leaned '485' it; in my ears '28' '4' low hum of sails, '22' beginning to shake in '4' '768'd; I '147' my '495' '85' '422'; I '28' '499' conscious of '966' my fingers to '4' lids '6' mechanic'34'y stretching '116' s'773' fur'4'r a'348'. But, spite of '34' '14', I '87' '66' no com'962' '165' me to steer by; '463' it '562'ed '33' a '294' '317' I '97' '91' '763' '4' '324'd, by '4' steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. No'124' '562'ed '165' me '33' a jet gloom, '56' '6' '98' '721'e g'129'tly by fla'50's of '796'ness. Upper'344' '28' '4' impression, '7' w'413'ver swift, rushing '124' I s'111'd on '28' '23' so '137' bound to '138' '19'n '531' as rushing '83' '34' '19'ns astern. A stark, bewilde'796' '174'ing, as of '548', '246' '118' me. Convulsively my '524' grasped '4' '773'er, '33' '31' '4' '419' c'336'it '7' '4' '773'er '28', '96''60', in '96' enchanted '103', inverted. My God! '11' is '4' '301' '31' me? '147' I. Lo! in my brief '503' I '97' '391'ed '302' '39', '6' '28' '569'ing '4' ship's stern, '31' my '78' to '49' prow '6' '4' com'962'. In an instant I '352'd '78', '22' in '75' to pr'140't '4' vessel '83' f'666' up '155' '4' '768'd, '6' '131' '307' capsizing '49'. How '431' '6' '60' grateful '4' re'596'f '83' '14' unnatural h'34'ucination of '4' '168', '6' '4' fatal contingency of '213' '561' by '4' lee!
Look '23' '111' '192' in '4' '352' of '4' '522', O '128'! N'167' '710' '31' thy h'6' on '4' helm! Turn '23' thy '78' to '4' com'962'; accept '4' '171' hint of '4' '479'ching '773'er; '172' '23' '4' artificial '522', '74' '716' '796'ness '408' '34' '124's '73' g'129'tly. To-morrow, in '4' natural sun, '4' skies '76' be b'40'; '200' '94' gla'796' '46' d'779's in '4' '17'king flames, '4' morn '76' s'60' in '458' '173', at '402' gentler, re'596'f; '4' glorious, g'261'en, '431' sun, '4' '146' '354' lamp—'34' '173's '33' liars!
N'167''4''759' '4' sun hides '23' Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor '34' '4' '827's of miles of deserts '6' of griefs ben'545'h '4' moon. The sun hides '23' '4' ocean, '265' is '4' '967' '500' of '14' '987', '6' '265' is '149' thirds of '14' '987'. So, t'43''17'e, '7' mortal '128' '94' hath '117' of joy '169' sorrow in '58', '7' mortal '128' '51''23' be '354'—'23' '354', or undeveloped. With '560's '4' '276'. The '354'st of '34' '508' '28' '4' Man of Sorrows, '6' '4' '354'st of '34' '560's is Solomon's, '6' Ecclesiastes is '4' '178' hamme'796' steel of woe. "All is vanity." ALL. T'90' wilful '296' hath '23' '61' '330' of unchristian Solomon's wisdom '332'. But he '94' dodges '467's '6' '872's, '6' '459's '692' crossing graveyards, '6' '72' '743' '150' of operas '169' '245'; c'34's Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, '719' d'779's '34' of '541' '508'; '6' '209''44' a '324'e-'523' '139''75' '746's by Rabelais as '962'ing wise, '6' t'43''17'e jolly;—'23' '7' '128' is fitted to '421' d'249' on tomb-st'913', '6' '448' '4' green damp mould '31' unfathomably wondrous Solomon.
But '140' Solomon, he '415', "'4' '128' '7' w'6'ereth '44' of '4' '103' of '447'st'6'ing sh'34' remain" (i.e., '140' '313' '565') "in '4' congregation of '4' '314'." Give '23' thy'968' up, '98', to '522', lest it invert '4'e, '314'en '4'e; as '17' '4' '75' it '64' me. T'43' is a wisdom '7' is woe; '33' t'43' is a woe '7' is '721'ness. And t'43' is a Cats'320' eagle in '96' souls '7' '51' a'46' dive d'249' '155' '4' '751'est gorges, '6' soar '44' of '116' '158' '6' be'67' invisible in '4' sunny spaces. And '140' if he '17' '167' f'596's '31'in '4' gorge, '7' gorge is in '4' mountains; so '7' '140' in '90' l'969'st swoop '4' mountain eagle is s'773' '530'er '169' '173' birds upon '4' plain, '140' '463' '69' soar.




CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.

Had '1' desc'398'ed '83' '4' Pequod's '244'-'176's to '4' Pequod's '17'ecastle, w'43' '4' '141' duty '430' '85' '503'ing, '17' '63' single mo'508't '1' '72' '19' al'344' '147' '1' '85' st'6'ing in '96' illuminated shrine of '51'onized kings '6' counsellors. T'43' '69' lay in '238' triangular oaken vaults, '356' mariner a c'90'elled mu'606'ess; a score of lamps flashing upon '90' hooded '495'.
In merchant'508', oil '17' '4' sailor is '117' s'324'ce '169' '4' milk of queens. To '926' in '4' '967', '6' '545' in '4' '967', '6' stumble in '967'ness to '90' p'34'et, '14' is '90' usual '202'. But '4' whale'128', as he '66'ks '4' '696' of '703', so he '349's in '703'. He '408' '90' berth an Aladdin's lamp, '6' lays '58' d'249' in it; so '7' in '4' pitchiest '168' '4' ship's '751' hull s'773' ho'364's an illumination.
See '31' '11' '797' '523'dom '4' whale'128' '726' '90' h'6'ful of lamps—of'606' '33' '261' bottles '6' vials, '463'—to '4' copper '494'er at '4' '244'-'176's, '6' repleni'50's '116' t'43', as mugs of ale at a vat. He burns, '111', '4' pu'426' of oil, in '716' un'128'u'418'u'796', '6', t'43''17'e, unvitiated '892'; a fluid un'677' to solar, lunar, or astral contrivances ashore. It is '584' as '865' gr'652' '33'ter in April. He '547' '6' hunts '17' '90' oil, so as to be '115' of '716' freshness '6' genuineness, '140' as '4' traveller on '4' pr'769'ie hunts up '90' '249' supper of '544'.




CHAPTER 98. Sto'768'g D'249' '6' Clea'847' Up.

Al'325' '129' it '91' re'399'd '60' '4' '164' levia'169' is a'458' '141' descried '83' '4' mast-'342'; '60' he is c'129'ed '118' '4' '604'y moors, '6' slaughte'796' in '4' v'34'eys of '4' deep; '60' he is '98' t'969'd '549''500' '6' be'342'ed; '6' '60' (on '4' principle '265' entitled '4' '342's'128' of '261' to '4' gar'508'ts in '265' '4' be'342'ed '28' '466') '90' '164' padded surt'44' be'67's '4' property of '90' exe'537'i'63'r; '60', in due '75', he is condemned to '4' pots, '6', '46' S'97'rach, Meshach, '6' A'515'nego, '90' spermaceti, oil, '6' b'63' '962' unsca'4'd '209' '4' '522';—'33' '56' it remains to conclude '4' '181' chapter of '14' '348' of '4' description by re'230'sing—singing, if I '289'—'4' ro'128'tic proceeding of de'51'ting '141' '90' oil '155' '4' c'257's '6' striking '116' d'249' '155' '4' '330', w'43' '336' '158' levia'169' re'391's to '90' native pro'427'dities, sliding '549' ben'545'h '4' sur'352' as '165'; '33', alas! n'167' '117' to rise '6' blow.
While s'773' '869'm, '4' oil, '46' '576' punch, is received '155' '4' '578'-'960'rel c'257's; '6' '313', '760', '4' ship is pitching '6' rolling '14' '103' '6' '7' in '4' mid'168' sea, '4' enormous c'257's '36' slewed round '6' '342'ed '118', '398' '17' '398', '6' so'559'imes perilously scoot across '4' slippery deck, '46' so '128'y l'6' slides, '773' at '181' '128'-'627'd '6' '235'ed in '238' '239'; '6' '34' round '4' hoops, rap, rap, go as '128'y hammers as '51' '412' upon '116', '17' '56', ex '141'icio, e'131' sailor is a cooper.
At length, '74' '4' '181' pint is c'257'ed, '6' '34' is '494', '98' '4' '164' hatch'103's '36' unsealed, '4' b'969'ls of '4' ship '36' '687'n '422', '6' d'249' go '4' c'257's to '238' final '426' in '4' sea. T'90' d'63', '4' hatches '36' re'226'd, '6' '49''559'ic'34'y '452'd, '46' a clo'451' w'34'ed up.
In '4' sperm fi'50'ry, '14' is '760' '63' of '4' '344' remark'473' incidents in '34' '4' '355' of whaling.

CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.

Ere '56' it '129' '91' re'399'd '60' Ahab '28' wont to pace '90' quarter-deck, '409' regular '391's at ei'4'r limit, '4' binnacle '6' mainmast; '33' in '4' multipli'709' of '173' '124's requi'847' narration it '129' '23' '91' added '60' '7' so'559'imes in '182' '459's, '74' '344' plunged in '90' mood, he '28' wont to pa'364' in '391' at '356' spot, '6' st'6' t'43' st'868'gely '784'ing '4' '348'icular object '165' '58'.

CHAPTER 100. Leg '6' Arm.

The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets '4' '469'uel Enderby, of London.

"Ship, ahoy! Hast '333' '4' W'479'e Whale?"
So cried Ahab, '336' '117' hailing a ship sho'768'g English col'119's, bea'847' d'249' '447' '4' stern. Trumpet to '843', '4' '261' '128' '28' st'6'ing in '90' hoisted quarter-boat, '90' ivory leg plainly revealed to '4' st'868'ger captain, '94' '28' '324'e'759'ly reclining in '90' '249' boat's bow. He '28' a '967'ly-tanned, burly, '68'-natu'796', '178'-'262' '128', of '578'ty or t'43''39's, '926'ed in a spacious round'39', '7' hung round '58' in fes'111'ns of blue pi'202'-c'202'h; '6' '63' empty arm of '14' jacket streamed '528' '58' '46' '4' broide'796' arm of a hussar's surcoat.
"Hast '333' '4' W'479'e Whale!"
"See '1' '14'?" '6' '31'dra'768'g it '83' '4' f'261's '7' '97' hidden it, he held up a '691' arm of sperm whale b'63', terminating in a wooden '342' '46' a m'34'et.
"Man my boat!" cried Ahab, impetuously, '6' tossing '39' '4' oars '958' '58'—"St'6' by to l'969'r!"
In '759' '169' a '294', '327' quitting '90' '105' craft, he '6' '90' crew '85' '705'ped to '4' '604', '6' '85' '358' '549''500' of '4' st'868'ger. But '43' a curious difficulty '986'ed '716'elf. In '4' excite'508't of '4' mo'508't, Ahab '97' '17''61''606' '7' '317' '4' loss of '90' leg he '97' n'167' '336' '761'ped on board of '138' vessel at sea '33' '90' '249', '6' '98' it '28' '194' by an ingenious '6' '131' h'6'y mechanical contrivance peculiar to '4' Pequod, '6' a '124' '23' to be rigged '6' shipped in '138' '173' vessel at a mo'508't's '869'ning. Now, it is no '131' '454' '301' '17' '138''618'—'722' '200' '94' '36' al'344' '612'ly '364'd to it, '46' whale'508'—to clamber up a ship's '500' '83' a boat on '4' '422' sea; '17' '4' '164' s'35's '56' lift '4' boat '530' up to'869'ds '4' bul'869'ks, '6' '98' instantaneously '705' it '499' '103' d'249' to '4' kel'273'. So, deprived of '63' leg, '6' '4' st'868'ge ship of '239' '213' alto'42''49' unsupp'596'd '31' '4' '207'ly invention, Ahab '56' '295' '58''968' abjectly '796'uced to a clumsy l'6's'128' '158'; '274''759'ly '784'ing '4' un'979' '397'ful h'879' he '87' '321'ly '274' to attain.
It '129' '165' '91' hinted, '760', '7' e'131' '105' unto'869'd circumstance '7' be'947' '58', '6' '265' indirectly sp'868'g '83' '90' '672''759' mishap, al'344' invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in '4' '986' instance, '34' '14' '28' heigh'606'ed by '4' sight of '4' '149' '493'rs of '4' st'868'ge ship, leaning '118' '4' '500', by '4' perp'398'icular ladder of nailed cleets t'43', '6' s'768'ging to'869'ds '58' a p'769' of taste'597'y-orna'508'ted '128'-ropes; '17' at '171' '69' '64' '23' '562' to be'54' '116' '7' a '63'-legged '128' '259' be '111' '137' of a cripple to '364' '238' sea bannisters. But '14' awk'869'dness '146' '181'ed a '294', beca'364' '4' st'868'ge captain, observing at a glance '60' af'807's s'111'd, cried '44', "I '66', I '66'!—avast heaving t'43'! Jump, '311's, '6' s'768'g '118' '4' '537'ting-tackle."
As '68' '672' '72' '19' it, '69' '97' '97' a whale '549''500' a '183' or '149' previous, '6' '4' '164' tackles '85' s'773' aloft, '6' '4' m'652'ive curved blubber-hook, '56' '817' '6' dry, '28' s'773' attached to '4' '398'. T'90' '28' quickly l'969''796' to Ahab, '94' at '336' compreh'398'ing it '34', slid '90' solitary t'530' '155' '4' curve of '4' hook (it '28' '46' '812' in '4' fluke of an anchor, or '4' crotch of an apple tree), '6' '98' '631' '4' '429', held '58''968' '692', '6' at '4' '276' '75' '516' '148'ed to hoist '90' '249' w'879', by '732'ing h'6'-'118'-h'6' upon '63' of '4' '573' '348's of '4' tackle. Soon he '28' '324'e'597'y swung in'500' '4' '530' bul'869'ks, '6' gently l'6'ed upon '4' capstan '342'. With '90' ivory arm f'868'kly thrust '17'th in wel'67', '4' '173' captain advanced, '6' Ahab, '966' '44' '90' ivory leg, '6' crossing '4' ivory arm ('46' '149' s'429'-fish blades) cried '44' in '90' walrus '103', "Aye, aye, '374'y! '123' us shake b'913' to'42''49'!—an arm '6' a leg!—an arm '7' n'167' '51' shrink, d'ye '66'; '6' a leg '7' n'167' '51' '366'. W'43' '64''st thou '66' '4' W'479'e Whale?—'60' '192' '414'?"
"The W'479'e Whale," '136' '4' English'128', '378'ing '90' ivory arm to'869'ds '4' East, '6' '409' a rueful sight '549' it, as if it '97' '91' a telescope; "t'43' I '282' '58', on '4' Line, '181' sea'273'."
"And he '111'k '7' arm '141', '64' he?" '257'ed Ahab, '56' sliding d'249' '83' '4' capstan, '6' '426'ing on '4' English'128''s '134'er, as he '64' so.
"Aye, he '28' '4' ca'364' of it, at '402'; '6' '7' leg, '111'?"
"Spin me '4' yarn," '136' Ahab; "'60' '28' it?"
"It '28' '4' '171' '75' in my '139' '7' I '167' cruised on '4' Line," began '4' English'128'. "I '28' igno'868't of '4' W'479'e Whale at '7' '75'. Well, '63' '183' we l'969''796' '17' a pod of '492' or '401' whales, '6' my boat fas'606'ed to '63' of '116'; a regular circus horse he '28', '111', '7' '277' milling '6' milling round so, '7' my boat's crew '87' '146' trim dish, by '812' '34' '238' sterns on '4' '44'er '723'wale. Pre'708'ly up br'356'es '83' '4' bottom of '4' sea a bouncing '164' whale, '31' a milky-'691' '342' '6' hump, '34' crows' '908' '6' wrinkles."
"It '28' he, it '28' he!" cried Ahab, suddenly '123'ting '44' '90' susp'398'ed br'545'h.
"And harpoons '856'ing in '958' '90' starboard fin."
"Aye, aye—'69' '85' '462'—my irons," cried Ahab, exultingly—"'33' on!"
"Give me a '365', '98'," '136' '4' English'128', '68'-hu'117'dly. "Well, '14' '261' '164'-gr'6''233', '31' '4' '691' '342' '6' hump, '366's '34' afoam '155' '4' pod, '6' '547' to snapping furiously at my '692'-'518'!
"Aye, I '66'!—'53'ed to '348' it; '523' '4' '692'-fish—an '261' trick—I k'56' '58'."
"How it '28' '304'," continued '4' '63'-armed com'128'der, "I do '23' k'56'; '33' in '437'ing '4' '518', it '61' foul of '90' teeth, '808' t'43' '96''60'; '33' we '64'n't k'56' it '98'; so '7' '74' we '180''869'ds '732'ed on '4' '518', bounce we '246' plump on to '90' hump!

And '54'ing '4' hap-hazard '518' '72' '42' loose, or '4' '111'th it '28' tangled to '240' draw ('17' I '19' a d'779' of a boat's crew '17' a '732' on a whale-'518'); '66'ing '34' '14', I '99', I jumped '155' my '171' mate's boat—'197' Mount'739''s '43' (by '4' '103', Captain—Mount'739'; Mount'739'—'4' captain);—as I '28' '99'ing, I jumped '155' Mount'739''s boat, '265', d'ye '66', '28' '723'wale '6' '723'wale '31' '462', '98'; '6' snatching '4' '171' harpoon, '123' '14' '261' '164'-gr'6''233' '19' it. But, Lord, '73' '1', '284'—'374's '6' souls a'349', '128'—'4' '290' instant, in a jiff, I '28' blind as a bat—'312' '495' '44'—'34' befogged '6' '515'eadened '31' '751' foam—'4' whale's tail looming '688' up '44' of it, perp'398'icular in '4' '769', '46' a marble steeple. No '364' sterning '34', '98'; '33' as I '28' groping at mid'183', '31' a blinding sun, '34' cr'249'-jewels; as I '28' groping, I '99', '180' '4' '347' iron, to toss it '118'board—d'249' '67's '4' tail '46' a Lima t'969'r, '537'ting my boat in '149', '568' '356' '499' in splinters; '6', flukes '171', '4' '691' hump '78'ed '209' '4' wreck, as '463' it '28' '34' chips. We '34' struck '44'. To escape '90' '816' flailings, I seized '330' of my harpoon-pole '856'ing in '58', '6' '17' a mo'508't clung to '7' '46' a sucking fish. But a combing sea da'50'd me '141', '6' at '4' '276' instant, '4' fish, '409' '63' '68' dart '17''869'ds, '277' d'249' '46' a flash; '6' '4' '960'b of '7' cursed '347' iron to'768'g '549' '958' me '808' me '43'" (clapping '90' h'6' '22' below '90' '134'er); "'89', '808' me '22' '43', I '99', '6' bore me d'249' to Hell's flames, I '28' '54'ing; '74', '74', '34' of a sudden, '144' '4' '68' God, '4' '960'b ript '716' '103' '549' '4' flesh—'574' '549' '4' '251' length of my arm—'246' '44' nigh my wrist, '6' up I floated;—'6' '7' gentle'128' t'43' '76' '81' '1' '4' '426' (by '4' '103', captain—'373' Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger, my lad,—'4' captain). Now, Bunger '311', spin y'119' '348' of '4' yarn."
The professional gentle'128' thus familiarly '378'ed '44', '97' '91' '34' '4' '75' st'6'ing '958' '116', '31' no'124' specific visible, to de'23'e '90' gentle'128'ly '868'k on board.

But, at '90' superior's introduction of '58' to Ahab, he politely b'969'd, '6' '688''103' '277' on to do '90' captain's bidding.
"It '28' a shocking '217' wound," began '4' whale-surgeon; "'6', '409' my adv'972', Captain Boomer '43', s'111'd '119' '261' '469'my—"

CHAPTER 101. The De'51'ter.

Ere '4' English ship fades '83' sight, be it '451' d'249' '43', '7' '50' hailed '83' London, '6' '28' '275'd '180' '4' '399' '469'uel Enderby, merchant of '7' '709', '4' original of '4' famous whaling ho'364' of Enderby & Sons; a ho'364' '265' in my '719' whale'128''s opinion, '67's '23' '458' '528' '4' united royal ho'364's of '4' Tudors '6' B'119'bons, in '378' of '272' '90'torical inte'426'. How '192', prior to '4' '407' of '119' Lord 1775, '14' '164' whaling ho'364' '28' in exis'606'ce, my numerous fish-docu'508'ts do '23' '106' plain; '33' in '7' '407' (1775) it fitted '44' '4' '171' English ships '7' '167' regularly hunted '4' Sperm Whale; '463' '17' '96' score of '266' previous ('167' '317' 1726) '119' valiant C'141'ins '6' Maceys of Nantucket '6' '4' Vineyard '97' in large fleets pursued '7' Levia'169', '33' '146' in '4' North '6' S'44'h Atlantic: '23' '234'w'43'. Be it distinctly recorded '43', '7' '4' Nantucketers '85' '4' '171' among '128''207' to harpoon '31' civilized steel '4' '164' Sperm Whale; '6' '7' '17' '499' a century '69' '85' '4' '146' '151' of '4' '251' globe '94' so harpo'63'd '58'.
In 1778, a '178' ship, '4' Amelia, fitted '44' '17' '4' express purpose, '6' at '4' sole charge of '4' vigorous Enderbys, b'261'ly rounded Cape Horn, '6' '28' '4' '171' among '4' nations to l'969'r a whale-boat of '138' '563' in '4' '164' S'44'h Sea. The voyage '28' a skilful '6' '672'y '63'; '6' re'391'ing to '49' berth '31' '49' '330' '597' of '4' precious sperm, '4' Amelia's example '28' '358' '858'ed by '173' ships, English '6' Ameri'51', '6' thus '4' vast Sperm Whale grounds of '4' Pacific '85' '687'n '422'. But '23' con'606't '31' '14' '68' deed, '4' indefatig'473' ho'364' '158' '258'ir'796' '716'elf: '469'uel '6' '34' '90' Sons—'60' '128'y, '238' m'173' '146' '359'—'6' '447' '238' immediate ausp'972's, '6' '348'ly, I '54', at '238' expense, '4' British g'118'n'508't '28' induced to '642' '4' sloop-of-'869' Rattler on a whaling voyage of disco'131' '155' '4' S'44'h Sea. Com'128'ded by a naval Post-Captain, '4' Rattler '721'e a rattling voyage of it, '6' '64' '96' serv'972'; '60' '137' '185' '23' appear. But '14' is '23' '34'. In 1819, '4' '276' ho'364' fitted '44' a disco'131' whale ship of '238' '249', to go on a tasting cruise to '4' remote '604's of Japan. That ship—'35' c'34'ed '4' "Syren"—'721'e a noble experi'508'tal cruise; '6' it '28' thus '7' '4' '164' Japanese Whaling Ground '171' be'246' gener'34'y '677'. The Syren in '14' famous voyage '28' com'128'ded by a Captain C'141'in, a Nantucketer.
All hon'119' to '4' Enderbies, t'43''17'e, '94'se ho'364', I '54', exists to '4' '986' '183'; '463' doubt'759' '4' original '469'uel '259' '192' '414' '19' slipped '90' c'473' '17' '4' '164' S'44'h Sea of '4' '173' '296'.
The ship '275'd '180' '58' '28' '736'y of '4' hon'119', '213' a '131' '692' sailer '6' a noble craft e'131' '103'. I boarded '49' '336' at mid'168' '96'w'43' '141' '4' Pat'414'nian coast, '6' d'868'k '68' flip d'249' in '4' '17'ecastle. It '28' a '178' gam we '97', '6' '69' '85' '34' trumps—e'131' soul on board. A '940' '139' to '116', '6' a jolly '548'. And '7' '178' gam I '97'—'192', '131' '192' '180' '261' Ahab '678'ed '49' '519'ks '31' '90' ivory heel—it '241's me of '4' noble, solid, Saxon '467'ity of '7' ship; '6' '289' my par'273' '353' me, '6' '4' d'779' '219' me, if I '167' '521' sight of it. Flip? Did I '99' we '97' flip? Yes, '6' we flipped it at '4' rate of '606' g'34'ons '4' '612'; '6' '74' '4' squ'34' '246' ('17' '30' squ'34'y '141' t'43' by Pat'414'nia), '6' '34' '524'—vi'421'ors '6' '34'—'85' c'34'ed to reef '739'sails, we '85' so '739'-heavy '7' we '97' to s'768'g '356' '173' aloft in bow'518's; '6' we igno'868'tly furled '4' skirts of '119' jackets '155' '4' sails, so '7' we hung t'43', reefed '692' in '4' '60'ling gale, a '869'ning example to '34' d'366'ken tars. How'167', '4' masts '64' '23' go '118'board; '6' by '6' by we scrambled d'249', so sober, '7' we '97' to '962' '4' flip '158', '463' '4' savage salt spray bursting d'249' '4' '17'ecastle s'537'tle, '743' '111' '137' diluted '6' '512'led it to my taste.
The beef '28' '178'—'889', '33' '31' '618' in it. T'84' '136' it '28' bull-beef; '173's, '7' it '28' dromedary beef; '33' I do '23' k'56', '17' '979', '60' '7' '28'. T'84' '97' dumplings '111'; sm'34', '33' substantial, sym'559'ric'34'y globular, '6' indestructible dumplings. I fancied '7' '1' '87' '174' '116', '6' roll '116' '39' in '1' '180' '69' '85' sw'34''969'd. If '1' s'111'ped '118' '111' '458' '17''869'd, '1' risked '238' pitching '44' of '1' '46' '899'iard-b'34's. The b'504'—'33' '7' '87'n't be '148'ed; be'500's, it '28' an anti-scor'33'ic; in '940', '4' b'504' contained '4' '146' fresh f'36' '69' '97'. But '4' '17'ecastle '28' '23' '131' '703', '6' it '28' '131' '454' to '761' '118' '155' a '967' corner '74' '1' ate it. But '34' in '34', '409' '49' '83' truck to helm, con'500''847' '4' di'508'sions of '4' cook's boilers, including '90' '249' '349' parch'508't boilers; '17'e '6' aft, I '99', '4' '469'uel Enderby '28' a jolly ship; of '68' f'36' '6' plenty; '178' flip '6' '777'; crack '947'ows '34', '6' capital '83' boot heels to hat-b'6'.
But '65' '28' it, '54' ye, '7' '4' '469'uel Enderby, '6' '96' '173' English whalers I k'56' of—'23' '34' '463'—'85' '375' famous, hospit'473' ships; '7' '962'ed round '4' beef, '6' '4' b'504', '6' '4' '51', '6' '4' joke; '6' '85' '23' '358' '854'y of '545'ing, '6' '580'ing, '6' laughing? I '76' '81' '1'. The abounding '68' cheer of '182' English whalers is '301' '17' '90'torical research. Nor '19' I '91' at '34' spa'847' of '90'torical whale research, '74' it '129' '562'ed '643'.
The English '85' preceded in '4' whale fi'50'ry by '4' Holl'6'ers, Zeal'6'ers, '6' Danes; '83' '94'm '69' derived '128'y terms s'773' extant in '4' fi'50'ry; '6' '11' is '332' '117', '238' fat '261' fashions, '678'ing plenty to '545' '6' '580'. For, as a general '124', '4' English merchant-ship scrimps '49' crew; '33' '23' so '4' English whaler. Hence, in '4' English, '14' '124' of whaling '68' cheer is '23' '975' '6' natural, '33' incidental '6' '348'icular; '6', t'43''17'e, '259' '19' '96' '591' origin, '265' is '43' '378'ed '44', '6' '76' be s'773' fur'4'r eluci'517'd.
Du'847' my researches in '4' Levia'169'ic '90'tories, I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume, '265', by '4' '259'y whaling smell of it, I k'212' '259' be '39' whalers. The title '28', "Dan Coop'128'," w'43''17'e I concluded '7' '14' '259' be '4' invalu'473' memoirs of '96' Amsterdam cooper in '4' fi'50'ry, as e'131' whale ship '259' '324'ry '716' cooper. I '28' rein'17'ced in '14' opinion by '66'ing '7' it '28' '4' production of '63' "Fitz Swackhammer." But my fri'398' '373' Snod'342', a '131' '819'ed '128', professor of Low Dutch '6' High Ger'128' in '4' '894' of Santa Claus '6' St. Pott's, to '94'm I h'6'ed '4' '176' '17' t'868'slation, '631' '58' a '990' of sperm '51'dles '17' '90' '461'—'14' '276' '373' Snod'342', so '358' as he spied '4' '560', '652'u'796' me '7' "Dan Coop'128'" '64' '23' '80' "The Cooper," '33' "The Merchant." In '940', '14' ancient '6' '819'ed Low Dutch '560' tr'545'ed of '4' commerce of Holl'6'; '6', among '173' subjects, contained a '131' '928' ac'893' of '716' whale fi'50'ry. And in '14' chapter it '28', '342'ed, "Smeer," or "Fat," '7' I '295' a '192' detailed '919' of '4' '44'f'716' '17' '4' larders '6' cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whale'508'; '83' '265' '919', as t'868's'399'd by '373' Snod'342', I t'868'scribe '4' '858'ing:
400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesl'6' pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft b'504'. 2,800 firkins of '33'ter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese ('307' an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 '960'rels of beer.
Most statistical t'473's '36' parchingly dry in '4' '504'ing; '23' so in '4' '986' '390', '60''167', w'43' '4' '504'er is flooded '31' '251' pipes, '960'rels, quarts, '6' gills of '68' gin '6' '68' cheer.
At '4' '75', I devoted '291' '433' to '4' studious digesting of '34' '14' beer, beef, '6' b'504', du'847' '265' '128'y pro'295' '147's '85' incident'34'y suggested to me, cap'473' of a t'868'sc'398'ental '6' Platonic application; '6', fur'4'r'117', I compiled supple'508'tary t'473's of my '249', '678'ing '4' prob'473' quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by e'131' Low Dutch harpo'63'er in '7' ancient Greenl'6' '6' Spitzbergen whale fi'50'ry. In '4' '171' '226', '4' amount of '33'ter, '6' Texel '6' Leyden cheese consumed, '562's '738'. I im'186'e it, '463', to '238' natur'34'y unctuous natures, '213' r'398'e'796' s'773' '117' unctuous by '4' nature of '238' vocation, '6' especi'34'y by '238' pursuing '238' '544' in '200' frigid Polar Seas, on '4' '131' coasts of '7' Esquimaux '893'ry w'43' '4' convivial natives pledge '356' '173' in bumpers of train oil.
The quantity of beer, '111', is '131' large, 10,800 '960'rels. Now, as '200' polar fi'50'ries '87' '146' be prose'924'd in '4' '940' summer of '7' climate, so '7' '4' '251' cruise of '63' of '182' Dutch whale'508', including '4' '940' voyage to '6' '83' '4' Spitzbergen sea, '64' '23' '137' exceed '291' '611', '99', '6' reckoning 30 '508' to '356' of '238' fleet of 180 sail, we '19' 5,400 Low Dutch sea'508' in '34'; t'43''17'e, I '99', we '19' precisely '149' '960'rels of beer per '128', '17' a twelve '731'' '34'owance, exclusive of '90' '807' proportion of '7' 550 ankers of gin. Now, whe'4'r '182' gin '6' beer harpo'63'ers, so fuddled as '63' '240' fancy '116' to '19' '91', '85' '4' '40' '563' of '508' to st'6' up in a boat's '342', '6' '101' '68' aim at f'666' whales; '14' '72' '562' '96''11' improb'473'. Yet '69' '64' aim at '116', '6' '479' '116' '111'. But '14' '28' '131' '458' North, be it '219'ed, w'43' beer '897's '35' '31' '4' constitution; upon '4' Equator, in '119' sou'4'rn fi'50'ry, beer '72' be apt to '106' '4' harpo'63'er '503'y at '4' mast-'342' '6' boozy in '90' boat; '6' grievous loss '240' ensue to Nantucket '6' New Bed'17'd.
But no '117'; '243' '129' '91' '136' to s'60' '7' '4' '261' Dutch whalers of '149' or '291' centuries '414' '85' '530' '349'rs; '6' '7' '4' English whalers '19' '23' neglected so excellent an example. For, '99' '69', '74' cruising in an empty ship, if '1' '51' '42' no'124' '166' '44' of '4' '296', '42' a '68' '484' '44' of it, at '402'. And '14' empties '4' de'51'ter.




CHAPTER 102. A B'969'r in '4' Arsacides.

Hi'4'rto, in descriptively tr'545'ing of '4' Sperm Whale, I '19' chiefly dwelt upon '4' marvels of '90' '44'er aspect; or separately '6' in detail upon '96' '360' interior structural f'545'ures. But to a large '6' thorough sweeping comprehension of '58', it behooves me '56' to un'33'ton '58' s'773' fur'4'r, '6' untagging '4' '378's of '90' hose, unbuckling '90' garters, '6' casting loose '4' hooks '6' '4' '495' of '4' joints of '90' inner'344' b'913', '451' '58' '165' '1' in '90' ultimatum; '7' is to '99', in '90' unconditional ske'123'on.
But '60' '56', Ishmael? How is it, '7' '1', a mere oars'128' in '4' fi'50'ry, pre'606'd to k'56' aught '39' '4' subter'868'ean '348's of '4' whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon y'119' capstan, de'349'r lectures on '4' anatomy of '4' Cetacea; '6' by '148' of '4' '768'dl'652', '330' up a speci'508' rib '17' exhi'437'ion? Explain thy'968', Ishmael. Can '1' l'6' a '597'-gr'249' whale on y'119' deck '17' examination, as a cook di'50's a roast-pig? Surely '23'. A verit'473' witness '19' '1' '479''49'to '91', Ishmael; '33' '19' a '324'e '60' '1' seize '4' privilege of Jonah al'63'; '4' privilege of disc'119'sing upon '4' joists '6' beams; '4' r'180's, '885'-pole, '503'ers, '6' '447'-pinnings, '380' up '4' frame-'176' of levia'169'; '6' be'46' of '4' t'34'ow-vats, d'769'y-'267's, '33'teries, '6' cheeseries in '90' b'969'ls.
I confess, '7' '317' Jonah, '360' whale'508' '19' penetrated '131' '458' ben'545'h '4' skin of '4' adult whale; n'167''4''759', I '19' '91' b'759'ed '31' an opportunity to dissect '58' in miniature. In a ship I be'192'ed to, a sm'34' cub Sperm Whale '28' '336' bodily hoisted to '4' deck '17' '90' poke or bag, to '106' '50'aths '17' '4' '960'bs of '4' harpoons, '6' '17' '4' '342's of '4' lances. Think '1' I '123' '7' '365' go, '327' '970' my boat-hatchet '6' jack-knife, '6' '448'ing '4' seal '6' '504'ing '34' '4' con'606'ts of '7' '507' cub?
And as '17' my ex'735' k'56'ledge of '4' b'913' of '4' levia'169' in '238' gigantic, '597' gr'249' develop'508't, '17' '7' r'36' k'56'ledge I am indebted to my '399' royal fri'398' T'868'quo, king of T'868'que, '63' of '4' Arsacides. For '213' at T'868'que, '266' '414', '74' attached to '4' trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I '28' invited to sp'398' '348' of '4' Arsac'256'n holi'433' '31' '4' lord of T'868'que, at '90' re'789' palm villa at Pupella; a sea-'500' glen '23' '131' '458' distant '83' '11' '119' sailors c'34'ed Bamboo-T'249', '90' capital.
Among '128'y '173' '178' qualities, my royal fri'398' T'868'quo, '213' '964'ed '31' a dev'44' '112' '17' '34' '301's of '960''960'ic vertu, '97' '561' to'42''49' in Pupella w'413'ver r'36' '124's '4' '117' ingenious of '90' '151' '87' invent; chiefly '324'ved woods of '533' dev'972's, c'90'elled s'245's, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic '51'oes; '6' '34' '182' distri'33'ed among w'413'ver natural '683's, '4' '683'-fr'879'ed, tri'33'e-r'398'e'847' waves '97' cast upon '90' shores.
Chief among '182' latter '28' a '164' Sperm Whale, '265', '180' an unusu'34'y '192' raging gale, '97' '91' '295' '314' '6' str'6'ed, '31' '90' '342' '485' a cocoa-nut tree, '94'se plumage-'46', tufted droopings '562'ed '90' verdant jet. When '4' vast '618' '97' at '181' '91' s'798'ped of '716' fathom-deep enf'261'ings, '6' '4' b'913' be'67' dust dry in '4' sun, '98' '4' ske'123'on '28' '324'e'597'y t'868'sported up '4' Pupella glen, w'43' a gr'6' temple of lordly palms '56' '50'lte'796' it.
The ribs '85' hung '31' trophies; '4' vertebrae '85' '324'ved '31' Arsac'256'n annals, in st'868'ge hieroglyphics; in '4' skull, '4' priests '764' up an u'290'ingui'50'd aromatic flame, so '7' '4' mystic '342' '158' '708' '17'th '716' vap'119'y sp'44'; '313', susp'398'ed '83' a bough, '4' terrific l'969'r jaw vibrated '118' '34' '4' devotees, '46' '4' h'769'-hung s'429' '7' so aff'40'ed Damocles.
It '28' a wondrous sight. The wood '28' green as mosses of '4' Icy Glen; '4' trees s'111'd '530' '6' haughty, '174'ing '238' '565' sap; '4' industrious '987' ben'545'h '28' as a weaver's loom, '31' a gorgeous '324'pet on it, w'43'of '4' ground-vine '606'drils '17'med '4' '869'p '6' woof, '6' '4' '565' fl'969'rs '4' '575's. All '4' trees, '31' '34' '238' laden b'868'ches; '34' '4' shrubs, '6' ferns, '6' gr'652'es; '4' '921'age-'324'rying '769'; '34' '182' unceasingly '85' '735'ive. Through '4' lacings of '4' '224's, '4' '164' sun '562'ed a f'666' '472'tle weaving '4' un'854'ied verdure. Oh, '748' weaver! un'333' weaver!—pa'364'!—'63' '429'!—w'479''49' flows '4' fabric? '11' palace '289' it deck? w'43''17'e '34' '182' cease'759' toilings? Speak, weaver!—'235' thy h'6'!—'33' '63' single '429' '31' '4'e! Nay—'4' '472'tle f'596's—'4' '575's float '83' '17'th '4' loom; '4' fre'50't-rushing '324'pet '17' '167' slides '170'. The weaver-'152', he weaves; '6' by '7' weaving is he deafened, '7' he '230's no mortal '915'; '6' by '7' humming, we, '111', '94' '73' on '4' loom '36' deafened; '6' '146' '74' we escape it sh'34' we '230' '4' thous'6' '915's '7' '613' '209' it. For '140' so it is in '34' material '418'ories. The spoken '429's '7' '36' inaudible among '4' f'666' spindles; '200' '276' '429's '36' plainly '299' '327' '4' w'34's, bursting '83' '4' '422'ed '390''508'ts. T'43'by '19' villainies '91' detected. Ah, mortal! '98', be heedful; '17' so, in '34' '14' din of '4' '164' '296''s loom, thy subtlest '54'ings '289' be '118''299' a'458'.
Now, amid '4' green, '139'-'426''759' loom of '7' Arsac'256'n wood, '4' '164', '691', worshipped ske'123'on lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet, as '4' '167'-woven verdant '869'p '6' woof intermixed '6' hummed '187' '58', '4' '240'y idler '562'ed '4' cunning weaver; '58''968' '34' woven '118' '31' '4' vines; e'131' month '652'uming greener, fre'50'r verdure; '33' '58''968' a ske'123'on. Life f'261'ed D'545'h; D'545'h trellised Life; '4' grim '152' wived '31' '1'thful Life, '6' begat '58' curly-'342'ed glories.
Now, '74' '31' royal T'868'quo I vi'421'ed '14' wondrous whale, '6' '282' '4' skull an altar, '6' '4' artificial smoke asc'398'ing '83' w'43' '4' '272' jet '97' issued, I marvelled '7' '4' king '134' regard a chapel as an object of vertu. He laughed. But '117' I marvelled '7' '4' priests '134' '746' '7' smoky jet of '90' '28' genuine. To '6' fro I paced '165' '14' ske'123'on—bru'50'd '4' vines a'500'—'785' '209' '4' ribs—'6' '31' a b'34' of Arsac'256'n t'768'e, w'6'e'796', ed'474'd '192' amid '716' '128'y '768'ding, s'97'ed colonnades '6' arb'119's. But '358' my '518' '28' '44'; '6' '858'ing it '78', I emerged '83' '4' '422'ing w'43' I ente'796'. I '282' no '565' '124' '31'in; naught '28' t'43' '33' b'913'.
Cutting me a green measu'847'-rod, I '336' '117' dived '31'in '4' ske'123'on. From '238' arrow-slit in '4' skull, '4' priests perceived me '409' '4' altitude of '4' final rib, "How '56'!" '69' sh'44'ed; "Dar'st thou mea'115' '14' '119' '152'! That's '17' us." "Aye, priests—'35', '60' '192' do ye '106' '58', '98'?" But '43'upon a fierce con'704' rose among '116', c'336'rning '908' '6' inches; '69' cracked '356' '173''s sc'336's '31' '238' yard-'856's—'4' '164' skull echoed—'6' seizing '7' '672'y '365', I quickly concluded my '249' admea'115''508'ts.
These admea'115''508'ts I '56' propose to '451' '165' '1'. But '171', be it recorded, '7', in '14' '301', I am '23' '523' to utter '138' fancied mea'115''508't I '142'. Beca'364' t'43' '36' ske'123'on authorities '1' '51' refer to, to '704' my accuracy. T'43' is a Levia'169'ic M'364'um, '69' '81' me, in Hull, Engl'6', '63' of '4' whaling ports of '7' '893'ry, w'43' '69' '19' '96' '178' speci'508's of fin-'78's '6' '173' whales. Likewise, I '19' '299' '7' in '4' m'364'um of Manchester, in New Hampshire, '69' '19' '11' '4' proprietors c'34' "'4' '146' '475' speci'508' of a Greenl'6' or River Whale in '4' United States." More'118', at a '226' in '826'shire, Engl'6', Burton Const'473' by '275', a '979' Sir Clif'17'd Const'473' '129' in '90' possession '4' ske'123'on of a Sperm Whale, '33' of moderate size, by no '410' of '4' '597'-gr'249' magnitude of my fri'398' King T'868'quo's.
In '312' '390's, '4' str'6'ed whales to '265' '182' '149' ske'123'ons be'192'ed, '85' origin'34'y claimed by '238' proprietors upon similar grounds. King T'868'quo seizing '90' beca'364' he '53'ed it; '6' Sir Clif'17'd, beca'364' he '28' lord of '4' seignories of '200' '348's. Sir Clif'17'd's whale '129' '91' articu'399'd '209''44'; so '7', '46' a '164' chest of drawers, '1' '51' '422' '6' '472' '58', in '34' '90' bony cavities—sp'504' '44' '90' ribs '46' a gigantic fan—'6' s'768'g '34' '183' upon '90' l'969'r jaw. Locks '36' to be '186' upon '96' of '90' trap-'450's '6' '472'ters; '6' a foot'128' '76' s'60' round '670' vi'421'ors '31' a bunch of keys at '90' '500'. Sir Clif'17'd '54's of charging '149'pence '17' a peep at '4' w'90'pe'847' g'34'ery in '4' spinal column; '291'pence to '230' '4' echo in '4' hollow of '90' cerebellum; '6' '578'pence '17' '4' unriv'34'ed view '83' '90' '17'e'342'.
The ske'123'on di'508'sions I sh'34' '56' proceed to '451' d'249' '36' copied verbatim '83' my '40' arm, w'43' I '97' '116' tat'111'ed; as in my wild w'6'e'847's at '7' period, t'43' '28' no '173' secure '103' of preserving '375' valu'473' statistics. But as I '28' crowded '17' space, '6' wi'50'd '4' '173' '348's of my '618' to remain a blank page '17' a poem I '28' '98' composing—at '402', '11' untat'111'ed '348's '240' remain—I '64' '23' '461' '302' '31' '4' odd inches; nor, indeed, '134' inches at '34' enter '155' a congenial admea'115''508't of '4' whale.




CHAPTER 103. Mea'115''508't of The Whale's Ske'123'on.

In '4' '171' '226', I '392' to lay '165' '1' a '348'icular, plain '892''508't, '678'ing '4' '565' bulk of '14' levia'169', '94'se ske'123'on we '36' briefly to exhi'437'. Such a '892''508't '289' '831' '364'ful '43'.
According to a '324'eful calculation I '19' '721'e, '6' '265' I '348'ly base upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of s'140'ty tons '17' '4' largest sized Greenl'6' whale of '578'ty '908' in length; according to my '324'eful calculation, I '99', a Sperm Whale of '4' largest magnitude, '592'ween '879'y-'401' '6' ninety '908' in length, '6' so'559'hing '759' '169' '17'ty '908' in '716' '597'est circumference, '375' a whale '76' weigh at '402' ninety tons; so '7', reckoning thirteen '508' to a ton, he '72' con'500'rably '44'weigh '4' combined population of a '251' village of '63' thous'6' '63' hund'796' inha'437'ants.
Think '1' '23' '98' '7' brains, '46' yoked cattle, '134' be '186' to '14' levia'169', to '106' '58' at '34' budge to '138' l'6's'128''s imagination?
Having '287' in various '103's '186' '165' '1' '90' skull, sp'44'-hole, jaw, teeth, tail, '17'e'342', fins, '6' divers '173' '348's, I sh'34' '56' simply '378' '44' '11' is '344' '928' in '4' general bulk of '90' unobstructed b'913'. But as '4' colossal skull embraces so '131' large a proportion of '4' '797' ex'606't of '4' ske'123'on; as it is by '458' '4' '344' complicated '348'; '6' as no'124' is to be rep'545'ed c'336'rning it in '14' chapter, '1' '259' '23' fail to '324'ry it in y'119' '241', or '447' y'119' arm, as we proceed, '173'wise '1' '76' '23' gain a comp'123'e '23'ion of '4' general structure we '36' '39' to view.
In length, '4' Sperm Whale's ske'123'on at T'868'que measu'796' s'140'ty-'149' Feet; so '7' '74' '597'y invested '6' ex'606'ded in '139', he '259' '19' '91' ninety '908' '192'; '17' in '4' whale, '4' ske'123'on '521's '39' '63' fifth in length compa'796' '31' '4' '565' '618'. Of '14' s'140'ty-'149' '908', '90' skull '6' jaw comprised '96' t'277'y '908', '568' '96' fifty '908' of plain '78'-b'63'. Attached to '14' '78'-b'63', '17' so'559'hing '759' '169' a third of '716' length, '28' '4' '240'y circular b'257'et of ribs '265' '336' en'452'd '90' vitals.
To me '14' vast ivory-rib'515' chest, '31' '4' '192', unre'596'ved spine, ex'606'ding '458' '170' '83' it in a '688' '518', '23' a '105' resembled '4' hull of a '164' ship '212'-laid upon '4' stocks, '74' '146' '96' t'277'y of '49' naked bow-ribs '36' inserted, '6' '4' keel is '173'wise, '17' '4' '75', '33' a '192', disconnected timber.
The ribs '85' '606' on a '500'. The '171', to begin '83' '4' neck, '28' '958'ly '578' '908' '192'; '4' '347', third, '6' '492'th '85' '356' successively '192'er, '773' '1' '246' to '4' climax of '4' fifth, or '63' of '4' '845' ribs, '265' measu'796' '879' '908' '6' '96' inches. From '7' '348', '4' remaining ribs dimini'50'd, '773' '4' '606'th '6' '181' '146' spanned '401' '908' '6' '96' inches. In general thickness, '69' '34' bore a '562'ly correspondence to '238' length. The '845' ribs '85' '4' '344' arched. In '96' of '4' Arsacides '69' '36' '364'd '17' beams w'43'on to lay footpath b'885's '118' sm'34' streams.
In con'500''847' '182' ribs, I '87' '23' '33' be struck a'212' '31' '4' circumstance, so variously rep'545'ed in '14' '560', '7' '4' ske'123'on of '4' whale is by no '410' '4' mould of '90' invested '17'm. The largest of '4' T'868'que ribs, '63' of '4' '845' '913', occupied '7' '348' of '4' fish '265', in '139', is '164'est in depth. Now, '4' '164'est depth of '4' invested '618' of '14' '348'icular whale '259' '19' '91' at '402' '578'teen '908'; w'43'as, '4' corresponding rib measu'796' '33' '105' '117' '169' '879' '908'. So '7' '14' rib '146' conv'784'd '499' of '4' '354' '23'ion of '4' '565' magnitude of '7' '348'. Be'500's, '17' '96' '103', w'43' I '56' '282' '33' a naked spine, '34' '7' '97' '91' '336' wrapped round '31' tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, '593', '6' b'969'ls. S'773' '117', '17' '4' ample fins, I '43' '282' '33' a '360' dis'619'ed joints; '6' in '226' of '4' w'879'y '6' majestic, '33' b'63''759' flukes, an utter blank!
How vain '6' foolish, '98', '147' I, '17' timid untravelled '128' to '244' to compreh'398' a'40' '14' wondrous whale, by merely po'847' '118' '90' '314' at'606'uated ske'123'on, stretched in '14' peaceful wood. No. Only in '4' '374' of quickest perils; '146' '74' '31'in '4' eddyings of '90' '860' flukes; '146' on '4' pro'295' unbounded sea, '51' '4' '597'y invested whale be truly '6' '565'ly '295' '44'.
But '4' spine. For '7', '4' '258' '103' we '51' con'500'r it is, '31' a c'868'e, to pile '716' b'913' '530' up on '398'. No speedy enterprise. But '56' '30' d'63', it '388' '137' '46' Pompey's Pillar.
T'43' '36' '17'ty '6' odd vertebrae in '34', '265' in '4' ske'123'on '36' '23' locked to'42''49'. T'84' '344'ly '596' '46' '4' '164' knob'515' blocks on a Gothic spire, '17'ming solid '239's of heavy ma'273'ry. The largest, a '845' '63', is in width so'559'hing '759' '169' '291' '908', '6' in depth '117' '169' '492'. The sm'34'est, w'43' '4' spine '890'rs '170' '155' '4' tail, is '146' '149' inches in width, '6' '388' so'559'hing '46' a '691' '899'iard-b'34'. I '28' '163' '7' t'43' '85' s'773' sm'34'er '913', '33' '69' '97' '91' '387' by '96' '105' '51'nibal urchins, '4' priest's '566', '94' '97' stolen '116' to '412' marbles '31'. Thus we '66' '60' '7' '4' spine of '140' '4' hugest of '565' '124's '890'rs '141' at '181' '155' '910' '497''s '412'.




CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.

From '90' '240'y bulk '4' whale af'17'ds a '344' congenial '116'e w'43'on to enlarge, amplify, '6' gener'34'y expatiate. Would '1', '1' '87' '23' compress '58'. By '68' '40's he '134' '146' be tr'545'ed of in imperial folio. Not to '81' '118' '158' '90' fur'192's '83' spiracle to tail, '6' '4' yards he mea'115's '39' '4' waist; '146' '54' of '4' gigantic involutions of '90' in'704'ines, w'43' '69' '596' in '58' '46' '164' c'473's '6' hawsers coiled '170' in '4' subter'868'ean orlop-deck of a '518'-of-battle-ship.
Since I '19' '447''645' to '128''627' '14' Levia'169', it behooves me to ap'831' '302' omnisciently exhaustive in '4' enterprise; '23' '118''262' '4' '294'st seminal germs of '90' '593', '6' spinning '58' '44' to '4' utter'344' coil of '90' b'969'ls. Having '287' descri'515' '58' in '344' of '90' '986' ha'437'atory '6' anatomical peculiarities, it '56' remains to magnify '58' in an archaeological, fossi'139'rous, '6' antediluvian '378' of view. App'596'd to '138' '173' cr'545'ure '169' '4' Levia'169'—to an ant or a flea—'375' portly terms '240' '22'ly be deemed un'869''868'tably gr'6'iloquent. But '74' Levia'169' is '4' text, '4' '390' is alte'796'. Fain am I to stagger to '14' emprise '447' '4' w'879'iest '429's of '4' dictionary. And '43' be it '136', '7' '74''167' it '129' '91' convenient to consult '63' in '4' '239' of '182' dissertations, I '19' invariably '364'd a huge quarto edition of '608''273', expressly purc'129'ed '17' '7' purpose; beca'364' '7' famous lexicograp'49''s uncommon '771' bulk '117' fitted '58' to compile a lexicon to be '364'd by a whale author '46' me.
One of'606' '230's of '863'rs '7' rise '6' s'35' '31' '238' subject, '463' it '289' '562' '33' an ordinary '63'. How, '98', '31' me, writing of '14' Levia'169'? Unconsciously my chirography exp'6's '155' pla'324'd capitals. Give me a condor's quill! Give me Vesuvius' crater '17' an inkst'6'! Fri'398's, '330' my arms! For in '4' mere '735' of penning my '147's of '14' Levia'169', '69' '854'y me, '6' '106' me faint '31' '238' '44'r'356'ing comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include '4' '251' circle of '4' sciences, '6' '34' '4' generations of whales, '6' '508', '6' mastodons, '536', '986', '6' to '67', '31' '34' '4' revolving panoramas of empire on '987', '6' '209''44' '4' '251' universe, '23' excluding '716' suburbs. Such, '6' so magnifying, is '4' virtue of a large '6' liberal '116'e! We exp'6' to '716' bulk. To produce a '240'y '560', '1' '259' choose a '240'y '116'e. No '164' '6' '398'u'847' volume '51' '167' be writ'606' on '4' flea, '463' '128'y t'43' be '94' '19' '457' it.
Ere ente'847' upon '4' subject of Fossil Whales, I '986' my c'796'entials as a geologist, by stating '7' in my miscellaneous '75' I '19' '91' a st'63'-ma'273', '6' '516' a '164' digger of ditches, '51'als '6' '35's, '768'e-vaults, cellars, '6' cisterns of '34' '563's. Likewise, by '103' of preliminary, I de'284'e to re'241' '4' '504'er, '7' '313' in '4' ear'596'r geological strata t'43' '36' '295' '4' fossils of monsters '56' al'344' comp'123'ely extinct; '4' subsequent relics disc'118'ed in '11' '36' c'34'ed '4' Tertiary '17'mations '562' '4' connecting, or at '138' rate intercepted links, '592'ween '4' antichronical cr'545'ures, '6' '200' '94'se remote posterity '36' '136' to '19' ente'796' '4' Ark; '34' '4' Fossil Whales '479''49'to disc'118'ed be'192' to '4' Tertiary period, '265' is '4' '181' preceding '4' superficial '17'mations. And '463' '697' of '116' precisely '491' to '138' '677' species of '4' '986' '75', '69' '36' '332' sufficiently akin to '116' in general '952's, to '22'ify '238' '409' '868'k as Cetacean fossils.
Detached '785'n fossils of pre-adamite whales, frag'508'ts of '238' b'913' '6' ske'123'ons, '19' '31'in thirty '266' '536', at various intervals, '91' '295' at '4' base of '4' Alps, in Lom'960'dy, in F'868'ce, in Engl'6', in Scotl'6', '6' in '4' States of Louisiana, Mississippi, '6' Alabama. Among '4' '117' curious of '375' remains is '348' of a skull, '265' in '4' '407' 1779 '28' disinter'796' in '4' Rue Dauphine in Paris, a '940' '811' '422'ing al'344' directly upon '4' palace of '4' Tuileries; '6' b'913' disinter'796' in excavating '4' '164' docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon's '75'. Cuvier pronounced '182' frag'508'ts to '19' be'192'ed to '96' utterly un'677' Levia'169'ic species.
But by '458' '4' '344' '533' of '34' Cetacean relics '28' '4' al'344' comp'123'e vast ske'123'on of an extinct monster, '295' in '4' '407' 1842, on '4' '519'tation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken c'796'ulous slaves in '4' vicinity '111'k it '17' '4' b'913' of '63' of '4' f'34'en angels. The Alabama '456's decla'796' it a huge reptile, '6' '258''969'd upon it '4' '275' of Basilosaurus. But '96' speci'508' b'913' of it '213' '645' across '4' sea to Owen, '4' English Anatomist, it '391'ed '44' '7' '14' '34'eged reptile '28' a whale, '463' of a de'348'ed species. A '659'ifi'51't illustration of '4' '418', '158' '6' '158' rep'545'ed in '14' '560', '7' '4' ske'123'on of '4' whale furni'50's '33' '105' clue to '4' shape of '90' '597'y invested '618'. So Owen rechris'606'ed '4' monster Zeuglodon; '6' in '90' '888' '504' '165' '4' London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, '63' of '4' '344' extraordinary cr'545'ures '265' '4' mutations of '4' globe '19' b'202'ted '44' of exis'606'ce.
When I st'6' among '182' '240'y Levia'169' ske'123'ons, skulls, tusks, jaws, ribs, '6' vertebrae, '34' char'735'erized by '348'ial resemblances to '4' existing breeds of sea-monsters; '33' at '4' '276' '75' bea'847' on '4' '173' h'6' similar affinities to '4' annihi'399'd antichronical Levia'169's, '238' incalcul'473' seniors; I am, by a flood, borne '78' to '7' wondrous period, ere '75' '716'elf '51' be '136' to '19' be'723'; '17' '75' began '31' '128'. Here Sa'391''s grey chaos rolls '118' me, '6' I obtain dim, shudde'847' glimpses '155' '200' Polar eternities; '74' wedged bastions of '972' pressed '321' upon '11' '36' '56' '4' Tropics; '6' in '34' '4' 25,000 miles of '14' '296''s circumference, '23' an inha'437''473' h'6''s b'504'th of l'6' '28' visible. Then '4' '251' '296' '28' '4' whale's; '6', king of cr'545'ion, he '269' '90' '830' '549' '4' '986' '518's of '4' Andes '6' '4' Himmalehs. Who '51' s'60' a pedigree '46' Levia'169'? Ahab's harpoon '97' '50'd '261'er '593' '169' '4' Pharaoh's. Meth'364'lah '562's a '351'-'311'. I '73' round to shake '524' '31' Shem. I am horror-struck at '14' antemosaic, uns'119'ced exis'606'ce of '4' un'613''473' terrors of '4' whale, '265', '305' '91' '165' '34' '75', '259' '460' exist '180' '34' hu'128'e ages '36' '118'.
But '23' al'63' '129' '14' Levia'169' '269' '90' pre-adamite traces in '4' stereotype p'399's of nature, '6' in limest'63' '6' marl bequea'4'd '90' ancient bust; '33' upon Egyptian tab'123's, '94'se antiquity '562's to claim '17' '116' an al'344' fossi'139'rous char'735'er, we '156' '4' unmistak'473' print of '90' fin.

Nor '259' t'43' be omitted an'173' st'868'ge at'704'ation of '4' antiquity of '4' whale, in '90' '249' osseous post-diluvian '272'ity, as '451' d'249' by '4' vener'473' '608' '526', '4' '261' Bar'960'y traveller.

CHAPTER 105. Does '4' Whale's Magnitude Diminish?—Will He Perish?

Inas'137', '98', as '14' Levia'169' '67's flo'447'ing d'249' upon us '83' '4' '342'-'604's of '4' Eternities, it '289' be fitly inqui'796', whe'4'r, in '4' '192' '239' of '90' generations, he '129' '23' degenerated '83' '4' original bulk of '90' '284'es.
But upon investigation we '156', '7' '23' '146' '36' '4' whales of '4' '986' '183' superior in magnitude to '200' '94'se fossil remains '36' '295' in '4' Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to '128'), '33' of '4' whales '295' in '7' Tertiary system, '200' be'192'ing to '716' latter '17'mations exceed in size '200' of '716' ear'596'r '913'.
Of '34' '4' pre-adamite whales '332' exhumed, by '458' '4' largest is '4' Alabama '63' '508'ti'63'd in '4' '181' chapter, '6' '7' '28' '759' '169' s'140'ty '908' in length in '4' ske'123'on. W'43'as, we '19' '287' '333', '7' '4' '890'-mea'115' '145's s'140'ty-'149' '908' '17' '4' ske'123'on of a large sized modern whale. And I '19' '299', on whale'508''s authority, '7' Sperm Whales '19' '91' captu'796' '958' a hund'796' '908' '192' at '4' '75' of capture.
But '289' it '23' be, '7' '313' '4' whales of '4' '986' '612' '36' an advance in magnitude upon '200' of '34' previous geological periods; '289' it '23' be, '7' '317' Adam's '75' '69' '19' degenerated?
Assu'796'ly, we '259' conclude so, if we '36' to c'796'it '4' ac'893's of '375' gentle'508' as Pliny, '6' '4' ancient natura'919's gener'34'y.

But '76' '138' whale'128' '172' '182' stories? No. The whale of to-'183' is as '201' as '90' ancestors in Pliny's '75'. And if '167' I go w'43' Pliny is, I, a whale'128' ('117' '169' he '28'), '76' '106' b'261' to '81' '58' so.

CHAPTER 106. Ahab's Leg.

The precipitating '128'ner in '265' Captain Ahab '97' quitted '4' '469'uel Enderby of London, '97' '23' '91' unat'606'ded '31' '96' sm'34' violence to '90' '249' '369'. He '97' '703'ed '31' '375' energy upon a th'869't of '90' boat '7' '90' ivory leg '97' received a '499'-splinte'847' shock. And '74' '180' gaining '90' '249' deck, '6' '90' '249' pivot-hole t'43', he so vehe'508'tly wheeled round '31' an urgent com'128'd to '4' steers'128' (it '28', as '167', so'559'hing '39' '90' '23' stee'847' inflexibly '243'); '98', '4' '287' shaken ivory received '375' an additional twist '6' wrench, '7' '463' it s'773' remained '797', '6' to '34' appea'868'ces lusty, '332' Ahab '64' '23' deem it '797'ly '395''736'y.
And, indeed, it '562'ed sm'34' '301' '17' '683', '7' '17' '34' '90' pervading, '721' reck'759'ness, Ahab '64' at '464' '145' '324'eful heed to '4' condition of '7' '314' b'63' upon '265' he '348'ly s'111'd. For it '97' '23' '91' '131' '192' prior to '4' Pequod's sailing '83' Nantucket, '7' he '97' '91' '295' '63' '168' '666' pr'63' upon '4' ground, '6' insensible; by '96' un'677', '6' '562'ingly inexplic'473', unimagin'473' casualty, '90' ivory limb '305' '91' so violently dis'226'd, '7' it '97' s'101'-wise smit'606', '6' '34' '33' pierced '90' groin; nor '28' it '327' extreme difficulty '7' '4' '414'nizing wound '28' '797'ly cu'796'.
Nor, at '4' '75', '97' it failed to enter '90' mono'128'iac '241', '7' '34' '4' anguish of '7' '98' '986' suffe'847' '28' '33' '4' direct issue of a '17'mer woe; '6' he '111' plainly '562'ed to '66', '7' as '4' '344' poi'273'ous reptile of '4' marsh perpetuates '90' '207' as inevitably as '4' '584'est '273'gster of '4' grove; so, equ'34'y '31' e'131' feli'709', '34' miser'473' '140'ts do natur'34'y be'42' '238' '46'. Yea, '117' '169' equ'34'y, '147' Ahab; '317' '312' '4' ances'244' '6' posterity of Grief go fur'4'r '169' '4' ances'244' '6' posterity of Joy. For, '23' to hint of '14': '7' it is an inference '83' '979' '51'onic t'356'ings, '7' '313' '96' natural '932''508'ts '43' sh'34' '19' no '566' born to '116' '17' '4' '173' '296', '33', on '4' contrary, sh'34' be '858'ed by '4' joy-'497''759'ness of '34' '245''s desp'769'; w'43'as, '96' guilty mortal miseries sh'34' s'773' fertilely be'42' to '116'selves an etern'34'y progressive progeny of griefs beyond '4' grave; '23' at '34' to hint of '14', t'43' s'773' '562's an inequality in '4' deeper analysis of '4' '124'. For, '147' Ahab, '313' '140' '4' '530'est '987'ly felicities '167' '19' a '979' un'659'ifying pettiness lurking in '116', '33', at bottom, '34' '374'woes, a mystic '659'ifi'51'ce, '6', in '96' '508', an ar'397'lic gr'6'eur; so do '238' diligent tracings-'44' '23' be'596' '4' obvious deduction. To trail '4' genealogies of '182' '530' mortal miseries, '324'ries us at '181' among '4' s'119'ce'759' primogenitures of '4' '152's; so '7', in '4' '352' of '34' '4' '431', hay-'380' suns, '6' soft cymb'34'ing, round harvest-moons, we '259' '460' '145' in to '14': '7' '4' '152's '116'selves '36' '23' '17' '167' '431'. The inef'352''473', sad birth-mark in '4' brow of '128', is '33' '4' stamp of sorrow in '4' '659'ers.
Unwittingly '43' a '669' '129' '91' divulged, '265' '760' '240' '117' properly, in '451' '103', '19' '91' dis'452'd '165'. With '128'y '173' '348'iculars c'336'rning Ahab, '194' '97' it remained a mystery to '96', '65' it '28', '7' '17' a '979' period, '312' '165' '6' '180' '4' sailing of '4' Pequod, he '97' hidden '58''968' '170' '31' '375' Gr'6'-Lama-'46' exclusiveness; '6', '17' '7' '63' interval, sought speech'759' refuge, as it '85', among '4' marble senate of '4' '314'. Captain Peleg's bruited '385' '17' '14' '124' appea'796' by no '410' adequate; '463', indeed, as '678'ing '34' Ahab's deeper '348', e'131' revelation par'111'k '117' of '659'ifi'51't '967'ness '169' of ex'519'atory '703'. But, in '4' '398', it '34' '246' '44'; '14' '63' '301' '64', at '402'. That direful mishap '28' at '4' bottom of '90' temporary recl'364'ness.

So '7', '209' '238' zeal '17' '58', '69' '97' '34' conspi'796', so '458' as in '116' lay, to muffle up '4' k'56'ledge of '14' '124' '83' '173's; '6' hence it '28', '7' '23' '773' a con'500'r'473' interval '97' elapsed, '64' it t'868'spire upon '4' Pequod's decks.
But be '34' '14' as it '289'; '123' '4' un'333', am'201'uous synod in '4' '769', or '4' vindictive princes '6' po'606'tates of '522', '19' to do or '23' '31' '987'ly Ahab, '332', in '14' '986' '301' of '90' leg, he '111'k plain pr'735'ical procedures;—he c'34'ed '4' '324'penter.

A belaying pin is '295' '111' large to be easily inserted '155' '716' hole: '4' '324'penter claps it '155' '63' of '90' '167'-'325' v'972's, '6' '688''103' files it sm'34'er. A '387' l'6'-bird of st'868'ge plumage strays on board, '6' is '721'e a captive: '44' of '817' s'19'd rods of '40'-whale b'63', '6' cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, '4' '324'penter '408' a pa'152'a-'262' cage '17' it.

'Tis '33' in'465' arc'479'ecture to '106' a blind dome; '43''s '63'. No, no, no; I '259' '19' a lantern.
Ho, ho! That's it, '84'? Here '36' '149', '284'; '63' '76' serve my '391'.

CHAPTER 109. Ahab '6' Starbuck in '4' Cabin.

According to usage '69' '85' pumping '4' ship '290' '339'; '6' lo! no incon'500'r'473' oil '246' up '31' '4' '604'; '4' c'257's below '259' '19' sp'366'g a '217' leak. Much c'336'rn '28' s'60'n; '6' Starbuck '277' d'249' '155' '4' cabin to report '14' unfav'119''473' af'807'.*
*In Sperm-whale'508' '31' '138' con'500'r'473' quantity of oil on board, it is a regular semi'532'ly duty to conduct a hose '155' '4' '330', '6' drench '4' c'257's '31' sea-'604'; '265' '180''869'ds, at varying intervals, is re'367'd by '4' ship's pumps. Hereby '4' c'257's '36' sought to be '764' damply tight; '313' by '4' '397'd char'735'er of '4' '31'drawn '604', '4' mariners '504'ily detect '138' '525' leakage in '4' precious '324'go.
Now, '83' '4' S'44'h '6' West '4' Pequod '28' dra'768'g nigh to Formosa '6' '4' Ba'50'e Isles, '592'ween '265' '596's '63' of '4' tropical '44''123's '83' '4' China '604's '155' '4' Pacific. And so Starbuck '295' Ahab '31' a general chart of '4' oriental archipela'547' sp'504' '165' '58'; '6' an'173' separate '63' re'986'ing '4' '192' eastern coasts of '4' Japanese isl'6's—Niphon, Matsmai, '6' Sikoke. With '90' s'56'-'691' '212' ivory leg braced '485' '4' screwed leg of '90' t'473', '6' '31' a '192' p'366'ing-hook of a jack-knife in '90' h'6', '4' wondrous '261' '128', '31' '90' '78' to '4' gang'103' '450', '28' wrinkling '90' brow, '6' tracing '90' '261' '239's '158'.
"Who's t'43'?" hea'847' '4' foot'761' at '4' '450', '33' '23' '391'ing round to it. "On deck! Beg'63'!"
"Captain Ahab mis'726'; it is I. The oil in '4' '330' is leaking, '284'. We '259' up Burtons '6' '448' '44'."
"Up Burtons '6' '448' '44'? Now '7' we '36' nea'847' Japan; heave-to '43' '17' a '532' to tinker a parcel of '261' hoops?"
"Ei'4'r do '7', '284', or '28'te in '63' '183' '117' oil '169' we '289' '106' '68' in a '407'. What we '67' t'277'y thous'6' miles to '42' is '736' saving, '284'."
"So it is, so it is; if we '42' it."
"I '28' '613'ing of '4' oil in '4' '330', '284'."
"And I '28' '23' '613'ing or '54'ing of '7' at '34'. Beg'63'! Let it leak! '16' '34' aleak '302'. Aye! leaks in leaks! '23' '146' '597' of leaky c'257's, '33' '200' leaky c'257's '36' in a leaky ship; '6' '55' a '458' '623' p'703' '169' '4' Pequod's, '128'. Yet I '21' '188' to plug my leak; '17' '94' '51' '156' it in '4' deep-loaded hull; or '60' '274' to plug it, '140' if '295', in '14' '139''s '60'ling gale? Starbuck! '82' '23' '19' '4' Burtons hoisted."
"What '76' '4' '249'ers '99', '284'?"
"Let '4' '249'ers st'6' on Nantucket b'356' '6' '44'yell '4' Typhoons. What '324'es Ahab? Owners, '249'ers? Thou art '194' prating to me, Starbuck, '39' '200' miserly '249'ers, as if '4' '249'ers '85' my conscience. But '73' ye, '4' '146' '272' '249'er of '138''124' is '716' com'128'der; '6' hark ye, my conscience is in '14' ship's keel.—On deck!"
"Captain Ahab," '136' '4' '796'dening mate, '772' fur'4'r '155' '4' cabin, '31' a da'847' so st'868'gely '952'ful '6' cautious '7' it al'344' '562'ed '23' '146' e'131' '103' '66'king to avoid '4' s'703'est '44''869'd '128'ifestation of '716'elf, '33' '31'in '516' '562'ed '117' '169' '499' dis'395'ful of '716'elf; "A '166' '128' '169' I '240' '35' '962' '118' in '4'e '11' he '72' quickly '243' re'708' in a '507'er '128'; aye, '6' in a happier, Captain Ahab."
"D'779's! Dost thou '98' so '137' as d'36' to critic'34'y '54' of me?—On deck!"
"Nay, '284', '23' '332'; I do entr'545'. And I do d'36', '284'—to be '17'bea'847'! Sh'34' we '23' '447'st'6' '356' '173' '166' '169' '479''49'to, Captain Ahab?"
Ahab seized a loaded musket '83' '4' rack ('17'ming '348' of '344' S'44'h-Sea-'508''s cabin furniture), '6' '378'ing it to'869'ds Starbuck, exclaimed: "T'43' is '63' God '7' is Lord '118' '4' '987', '6' '63' Captain '7' is lord '118' '4' Pequod.—On deck!"
For an instant in '4' flashing '495' of '4' mate, '6' '90' fiery cheeks, '1' '72' '19' al'344' '147' '7' he '97' re'34'y received '4' blaze of '4' levelled tube. But, maste'847' '90' emotion, he '499' '804'ly rose, '6' as he quitted '4' cabin, pa'364'd '17' an instant '6' '136': "Thou '129't '44'raged, '23' insulted me, '284'; '33' '17' '7' I '257' '4'e '23' to bew'36' of Starbuck; thou '72'st '33' laugh; '33' '123' Ahab bew'36' of Ahab; bew'36' of thy'968', '261' '128'."
"He waxes brave, '33' n'167''4''759' obeys; '344' '324'eful bra'131' '7'!" murmu'796' Ahab, as Starbuck disappea'796'. "What's '7' he '136'—Ahab bew'36' of Ahab—t'43''s so'559'hing t'43'!" Then unconsciously '970' '4' musket '17' a staff, '31' an iron brow he paced to '6' fro in '4' '105' cabin; '33' '986'ly '4' thick pla'716' of '90' '17'e'342' '825'ed, '6' re'391'ing '4' '723' to '4' rack, he '277' to '4' deck.
"Thou art '33' '111' '68' a '947'ow, Starbuck," he '136' lowly to '4' mate; '98' raising '90' '915' to '4' crew: "Furl '4' t'g'34'ant-sails, '6' '452'-reef '4' '739'-sails, '17'e '6' aft; '78' '4' main-yard; up Burton, '6' '448' '44' in '4' main-'330'."
It '85' '760' vain to surmise '304' '65' it '28', '7' as '952'ing Starbuck, Ahab thus '735'ed. It '289' '19' '91' a flash of h'913'ty in '58'; or mere prudential policy '265', '447' '4' circumstance, imperiously '17''217'e '4' s'703'est symptom of '422' disaffection, '60''167' t'868'sient, in '4' '425' chief '493'r of '90' ship. How'167' it '28', '90' '619's '85' exe'924'd; '6' '4' Burtons '85' hoisted.




CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His C'141'in.

Upon searching, it '28' '295' '7' '4' c'257's '181' struck '155' '4' '330' '85' '475'ly '602', '6' '7' '4' leak '259' be fur'4'r '141'. So, it '213' '804' wea'4'r, '69' '785' '44' deeper '6' deeper, disturbing '4' slumbers of '4' huge ground-tier '33'ts; '6' '83' '7' '751' mid'168' '642'ing '200' gigantic moles '155' '4' '183''703' above. So deep '64' '69' go; '6' so ancient, '6' corroded, '6' weedy '4' aspect of '4' l'969'r'344' puncheons, '7' '1' al'344' '720' '290' '17' '96' mouldy corner-st'63' c'257' containing coins of Captain Noah, '31' copies of '4' posted pla'324'ds, vainly '869'ning '4' infatuated '261' '296' '83' '4' flood. Tierce '180' tierce, '111', of '604', '6' b'504', '6' beef, '6' shooks of staves, '6' iron bundles of hoops, '85' hoisted '44', '773' at '181' '4' piled decks '85' '321' to '42' '39'; '6' '4' hollow hull echoed '447' foot, as if '1' '85' t'504'ing '118' empty catacombs, '6' reeled '6' rolled in '4' sea '46' an '769'-fr'879'ed demijohn. Top-heavy '28' '4' ship as a '484''759' student '31' '34' Aristotle in '90' '342'. Well '28' it '7' '4' Typhoons '64' '23' vi'421' '116' '98'.
Now, at '14' '75' it '28' '7' my '719' pagan companion, '6' '692' bosom-fri'398', Queequeg, '28' seized '31' a f'167', '265' '561' '58' nigh to '90' '398''759' '398'.
Be it '136', '7' in '14' vocation of whaling, sinecures '36' un'677'; dignity '6' danger go h'6' in h'6'; '773' '1' '42' to be Captain, '4' '530'er '1' rise '4' '321'er '1' toil. So '31' '719' Queequeg, '94', as harpo'63'er, '259' '23' '146' '352' '34' '4' rage of '4' '565' whale, '33'—as we '19' '234'w'43' '333'—mount '90' '314' '78' in a rolling sea; '6' fin'34'y desc'398' '155' '4' gloom of '4' '330', '6' '437'terly sw'545'ing '34' '183' in '7' subter'868'eous con'178''508't, resolutely '128''627' '4' clumsiest c'257's '6' '66' to '238' stowage. To be '940', among whale'508', '4' harpo'63'ers '36' '4' '330'ers, so c'34'ed.
Poor Queequeg! '74' '4' ship '28' '39' '499' disembo'35'ed, '1' '134' '19' s'111'ped '118' '4' hatch'103', '6' pee'796' d'249' upon '58' t'43'; w'43', s'798'ped to '90' woollen drawers, '4' tat'111'ed savage '28' crawling '39' amid '7' dampness '6' slime, '46' a green spotted lizard at '4' bottom of a '35'. And a '35', or an '972'-ho'364', it '96''60' '831'd to '58', '719' pagan; w'43', st'868'ge to '99', '17' '34' '4' h'545' of '90' sw'545'ings, he '808' a '816' chill '265' lapsed '155' a f'167'; '6' at '181', '180' '96' '433'' suffe'847', laid '58' in '90' hammock, '452' to '4' '131' sill of '4' '450' of '548'. How he '28'ted '6' '28'ted '170' in '200' '360' '192'-linge'847' '433', '773' t'43' '562'ed '33' '105' '269' of '58' '33' '90' frame '6' tat'111'ing. But as '34' '234' in '58' thinned, '6' '90' cheek-b'913' grew sharper, '90' '495', n'167''4''759', '562'ed gro'768'g '597'er '6' '597'er; '69' be'246' of a st'868'ge softness of lustre; '6' mildly '33' deeply '720' '44' at '1' t'43' '83' '90' '541'ness, a wondrous '704'imony to '7' immortal health in '58' '265' '87' '23' '474', or be weakened. And '46' circles on '4' '604', '265', as '69' grow fainter, exp'6'; so '90' '495' '562'ed rounding '6' rounding, '46' '4' '847's of Eternity. An awe '7' '51''23' be '275'd '72' steal '118' '1' as '1' sat by '4' '500' of '14' waning savage, '6' '282' as st'868'ge '124's in '90' '352', as '138' beheld '94' '85' byst'6'ers '74' Zoroaster '474'd. For w'413'ver is truly wondrous '6' fearful in '128', n'167' '332' '28' '186' '155' '429's or '560's. And '4' dra'768'g '958' of D'545'h, '265' a'46' levels '34', a'46' impresses '34' '31' a '181' revelation, '265' '146' an author '83' '4' '314' '87' adequately '81'. So '7'—'123' us '99' it '158'—no dying Chaldee or Greek '97' '530'er '6' ho'596'r '147's '169' '200', '94'se mysterious s'97'es '1' '282' creeping '118' '4' '352' of '719' Queequeg, as he '935'ly lay in '90' s'103'ing hammock, '6' '4' rolling sea '562'ed gently rocking '58' to '90' final '426', '6' '4' ocean's invisible flood-tide lifted '58' '530'er '6' '530'er to'869'ds '90' destined heaven.
Not a '128' of '4' crew '33' '417' '58' up; '6', as '17' Queequeg '58''968', '11' he '147' of '90' '390' '28' '17'cibly s'60'n by a curious fav'119' he '257'ed. He c'34'ed '63' to '58' in '4' grey '339' '430', '74' '4' '183' '28' '22' '448'ing, '6' '409' '90' h'6', '136' '7' '313' in Nantucket he '97' '365'd to '66' '979' '105' '51'oes of '967' wood, '46' '4' rich '869'-wood of '90' native isle; '6' upon inquiry, he '97' '819'ed '7' '34' whale'508' '94' '474'd in Nantucket, '85' laid in '200' '276' '967' '51'oes, '6' '7' '4' fancy of '213' so laid '97' '137' '142'd '58'; '17' it '28' '23' un'46' '4' custom of '90' '249' race, '94', '180' embalming a '314' '869'rior, stretched '58' '44' in '90' '51'oe, '6' so '269' '58' to be floated '170' to '4' starry archipela'547'; '17' '23' '146' do '69' '172' '7' '4' stars '36' isles, '33' '7' '458' beyond '34' visible horizons, '238' '249' mild, uncontinented seas, interflow '31' '4' blue heavens; '6' so '17'm '4' '691' '448'ers of '4' milky '103'. He added, '7' he shudde'796' at '4' '147' of '213' buried in '90' hammock, according to '4' usual sea-custom, tossed '46' so'559'hing vile to '4' '548'-dev'119'ing sharks. No: he de'284'ed a '51'oe '46' '200' of Nantucket, '34' '4' '117' congenial to '58', '213' a whale'128', '7' '46' a whale-boat '182' c'141'in-'51'oes '85' '327' a keel; '463' '7' '745' '33' un'979' stee'847', '6' '137' lee-'103' ad'249' '4' dim ages.
Now, '74' '14' st'868'ge circumstance '28' '721'e '677' aft, '4' '324'penter '28' at '336' com'128'ded to do Queequeg's bidding, w'413'ver it '240' include. T'43' '28' '96' hea'98'ish, c'141'in-col'119'ed '261' lumber aboard, '265', upon a '192' previous voyage, '97' '91' '537' '83' '4' aboriginal groves of '4' Lacka'183' isl'6's, '6' '83' '182' '967' '519'ks '4' c'141'in '28' recom'508'ded to be '721'e. No '358'er '28' '4' '324'penter apprised of '4' '619', '169' '409' '90' rule, he '17'th'31' '31' '34' '4' in'465' promptitude of '90' char'735'er, proceeded '155' '4' '17'ecastle '6' '111'k Queequeg's mea'115' '31' '164' accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg's '369' as he shifted '4' rule.
"Ah! '719' '947'ow! '540' '19' to '474' '56'," ejacu'399'd '4' Long Isl'6' sailor.
Going to '90' v'972'-bench, '4' '324'penter '17' convenience '997' '6' general reference, '56' t'868'sfer'847'ly measu'796' on it '4' ex'735' length '4' c'141'in '28' to be, '6' '98' '721'e '4' t'868'sfer per'128'ent by '537'ting '149' '23'ches at '716' extremities. T'90' d'63', he marsh'34'ed '4' '519'ks '6' '90' '111'ls, '6' to '176'.
When '4' '181' nail '28' '698'n, '6' '4' lid duly '519'ed '6' fitted, he '703'ly '134'e'796' '4' c'141'in '6' '277' '17''869'd '31' it, inqui'847' whe'4'r '69' '85' '325' '17' it '332' in '7' direction.
Overhea'847' '4' indignant '33' '499'-humorous cries '31' '265' '4' '151' on deck began to '698' '4' c'141'in '170', Queequeg, to e'131' '63''s consternation, com'128'ded '7' '4' '124' '134' be instantly '561' to '58', nor '28' t'43' '138' denying '58'; '66'ing '7', of '34' mortals, '96' dying '508' '36' '4' '344' ty'868'nical; '6' '658', '317' '69' '76' '940'ly '461' us so '105' '17' '167''117', '4' '719' '947'ows ought to be indulged.
Leaning '118' in '90' hammock, Queequeg '192' regarded '4' c'141'in '31' an at'606'tive '784'. He '98' c'34'ed '17' '90' harpoon, '97' '4' wooden stock drawn '83' it, '6' '98' '97' '4' iron '348' '226'd in '4' c'141'in '549' '31' '63' of '4' paddles of '90' boat. All by '90' '249' request, '516', biscu'716' '85' '98' '868'ged round '4' '500's '31'in: a fl'257' of fresh '604' '28' '226'd at '4' '342', '6' a sm'34' bag of woody '987' scraped up in '4' '330' at '4' foot; '6' a '747' of sail-c'202'h '213' rolled up '17' a pillow, Queequeg '56' entr'545'ed to be lifted '155' '90' final '515', '7' he '240' '106' trial of '716' com'17'ts, if '138' it '97'. He lay '327' '772' a '360' '294's, '98' '163' '63' to go to '90' bag '6' b'847' '44' '90' '105' '152', Yojo. Then crossing '90' arms on '90' breast '31' Yojo '592'ween, he c'34'ed '17' '4' c'141'in lid (hatch he c'34'ed it) to be '226'd '118' '58'. The '342' '348' '391'ed '118' '31' a lea'4'r hinge, '6' t'43' lay Queequeg in '90' c'141'in '31' '105' '33' '90' composed coun'606'ance in view. "Rarmai" (it '76' do; it is '454'), he murmu'796' at '181', '6' '659'ed to be re'226'd in '90' hammock.
But ere '14' '28' d'63', Pip, '94' '97' '91' slily h'118'ing '958' by '34' '14' '313', drew nigh to '58' w'43' he lay, '6' '31' soft sobbings, '111'k '58' by '4' h'6'; in '4' '173', '956' '90' tamb'119'ine.
"Poor r'118'! '76' ye n'167' '19' d'63' '31' '34' '14' '854'y roving? w'43' go ye '56'? But if '4' currents '324'ry ye to '200' '584' An'773'es w'43' '4' b'356'es '36' '146' '942' '31' '604'-li'596's, '76' ye do '63' '105' err'6' '17' me?

"I '19' '299'," murmu'796' Starbuck, gazing d'249' '4' s'537'tle, "'7' in violent f'167's, '508', '34' igno'868'ce, '19' '649' in ancient tongues; '6' '7' '74' '4' mystery is pro'515', it '391's '44' '194' '7' in '238' '94'lly '17''61''606' '497'hood '200' ancient tongues '97' '91' re'34'y spoken in '238' hea'847' by '96' lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, '719' Pip, in '14' st'868'ge '584'ness of '90' lunacy, b'847's heavenly vouc'49's of '34' '119' heavenly '179's. W'43' '819'ed he '7', '33' t'43'?—Hark! he '613's '158': '33' '117' wildly '56'."
"Form '149' '6' '149'! Let's '106' a General of '58'! Ho, w'43''s '90' harpoon? Lay it across '43'.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh '17' a '544' cock '56' to '421' upon '90' '342' '6' crow!

Tell '116' he jumped '83' a whale-boat! '190' n'167' '942' my tamb'119'ine '118' base Pip, '6' hail '58' General, if he '85' '336' '117' dying '43'. No, no! shame upon '34' co'869'ds—shame upon '116'! Let '514' go dr'249' '46' Pip, '7' jumped '83' a whale-boat. Shame! shame!"
Du'847' '34' '14', Queequeg lay '31' '452'd '495', as if in a '710'. Pip '28' led '170', '6' '4' '541' '128' '28' re'226'd in '90' hammock.
But '56' '7' he '97' app'36'ntly '721'e e'131' preparation '17' '548'; '56' '7' '90' c'141'in '28' '831'd a '68' fit, Queequeg suddenly r'34'ied; '358' t'43' '562'ed no '107' of '4' '324'penter's '990': '6' t'43'upon, '74' '96' expressed '238' de'703'ed '715', he, in substance, '136', '7' '4' ca'364' of '90' sudden convalescence '28' '14';—at a critical mo'508't, he '97' '22' rec'34'ed a '105' duty ashore, '265' he '28' '568' und'63'; '6' t'43''17'e '97' '397'd '90' '241' '39' dying: he '87' '23' '474' '332', he aver'796'. T'84' '257'ed '58', '98', whe'4'r to '349' or '474' '28' a '301' of '90' '249' s'118'eign '76' '6' plea'115'. He '491'ed, '658'. In a '429', it '28' Queequeg's c'336'it, '7' if a '128' '721'e up '90' '241' to '349', mere '541'ness '87' '23' '320' '58': no'124' '33' a whale, or a gale, or '96' violent, ung'118'n'473', unin'81'igent destroyer of '7' '563'.
Now, t'43' is '14' '23'e'736'y difference '592'ween savage '6' civilized; '7' '313' a '541', civilized '128' '289' be '578' '611' convalescing, gener'34'y '613'ing, a '541' savage is al'344' '499'-'35' '158' in a '183'. So, in '68' '75' my Queequeg gained strength; '6' at length '180' '812' on '4' '768'dl'652' '17' a '360' indolent '433' ('33' '545'ing '31' a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to '90' '908', threw '44' '90' arms '6' legs, '417' '58''968' a '68' stretching, yawned a '105' '437', '6' '98' sp'847'ing '155' '4' '342' of '90' hoisted boat, '6' poising a harpoon, pronounced '58''968' fit '17' a '535'.
With a wild w'58'siness, he '56' '364'd '90' c'141'in '17' a sea-chest; '6' emptying '155' it '90' '51'vas bag of '945', '451' '116' in '619' t'43'.

CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.

When gliding by '4' Ba'50'e isles we emerged at '181' upon '4' '164' S'44'h Sea; '85' it '23' '17' '173' '124's, I '87' '19' greeted my '599' Pacific '31' un'893'ed '144's, '17' '56' '4' '192' supplication of my '1'th '28' '491'ed; '7' serene ocean rolled east'869'ds '83' me a thous'6' leagues of blue.
T'43' is, '63' '359' '23' '11' '584' mystery '39' '14' sea, '94'se gently awful stir'847's '562' to '613' of '96' hidden soul ben'545'h; '46' '200' f'473'd undulations of '4' Ephesian sod '118' '4' buried Evange'919' St. '608'. And '381' it is, '7' '118' '182' sea-'536'ures, wide-rolling '604'y pr'769'ies '6' Potters' Fields of '34' '492' continents, '4' waves '134' rise '6' f'34', '6' ebb '6' flow unceasingly; '17' '43', '827's of mixed s'97'es '6' s'97'ows, dr'249'ed '710's, somnambulisms, r'167'ies; '34' '7' we c'34' '349's '6' souls, '596' '710'ing, '710'ing, s'773'; tossing '46' slumberers in '238' '515's; '4' '167'-rolling waves '33' '721'e so by '238' '426''759'ness.
To '138' meditative Magian r'118', '14' serene Pacific, '336' beheld, '259' '167' '180' be '4' sea of '90' adoption. It rolls '4' mid'344' '604's of '4' '296', '4' Indian ocean '6' Atlantic '213' '33' '716' arms. The '276' waves '28'h '4' moles of '4' '212'-built Cali'17'nian t'249's, '33' '89'ter'183' '519'ted by '4' recen'704' race of '508', '6' lave '4' faded '33' s'773' gorgeous skirts of Asiatic l'6's, '261'er '169' Abraham; '313' '34' '592'ween float milky-'103's of coral isles, '6' low-'666', '398''759', un'677' Archipela'547', '6' impenetr'473' Japans. Thus '14' mysterious, divine Pacific z'913' '4' '296''s '251' bulk '39'; '408' '34' coasts '63' bay to it; '562's '4' tide-'942'ing '374' of '987'.

But '360' '147's of Pan stir'796' Ahab's brain, as st'6'ing '46' an iron statue at '90' accustomed '226' be'500' '4' mizen rigging, '31' '63' nostril he un'54'ingly snuffed '4' sugary musk '83' '4' Ba'50'e isles (in '94'se '584' woods mild '112'rs '259' be '459'ing), '6' '31' '4' '173' consciously inhaled '4' salt br'545'h of '4' '212' '295' sea; '7' sea in '265' '4' '413'd W'479'e Whale '259' '140' '98' be swimming.

His firm lips '559' '46' '4' lips of a v'972'; '4' Delta of '90' '17'e'342''s veins s'35'ed '46' '118'laden brooks; in '90' '131' '503', '90' '847'ing cry '868' '209' '4' vaulted hull, "Stern '34'!

CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.

Availing '58''968' of '4' mild, summer-'494' wea'4'r '7' '56' reigned in '182' latitudes, '6' in preparation '17' '4' peculiarly '735'ive pursu'716' '940'ly to be anticipated, Perth, '4' begrimed, b'919'e'796' '261' '751'smith, '97' '23' re'367'd '90' port'473' '17'ge to '4' '330' '158', '180' concluding '90' contri'33'ory '176' '17' Ahab's leg, '33' s'773' retained it on deck, '692' la'50'd to '847'bolts by '4' '17'emast; '213' '56' al'344' incessantly invoked by '4' '342's'508', '6' harpo'63'ers, '6' bows'508' to do '96' '105' '292' '17' '116'; alte'847', or repai'847', or '212' shaping '238' various weapons '6' boat furniture. Of'606' he '72' be surrounded by an eager circle, '34' '483' to be served; '956' boat-spades, pike-'342's, harpoons, '6' lances, '6' jealously '763' '90' e'131' sooty '367''508't, as he toiled. N'167''4''759', '14' '261' '128''s '28' a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance '64' '67' '83' '58'. Silent, slow, '6' solemn; bo'768'g '118' s'773' fur'4'r '90' chronic'34'y '785'n '78', he toiled '170', as if toil '85' '139' '716'elf, '6' '4' heavy '942'ing of '90' hammer '4' heavy '942'ing of '90' '374'. And so it '28'.—Most miser'473'!
A peculiar '459' in '14' '261' '128', a '979' s'703' '33' '684'ful appea'847' ya'768'g in '90' gait, '97' at an '865' period of '4' voyage excited '4' curio'421'y of '4' mariners.

Be'399'd, '6' '23' innocently, '63' '437'ter '768'ter's mid'168', on '4' '937' '573' '592'ween '149' '893'ry t'249's, '4' '751'smith '499'-'489'ly '577' '4' '314'ly numbness stealing '118' '58', '6' sought refuge in a leaning, dilapi'517'd '960'n. The issue '28', '4' loss of '4' extremities of '312' '908'. Out of '14' revelation, '348' by '348', at '181' '246' '44' '4' '492' '735's of '4' '431'ness, '6' '4' '63' '192', '6' as '332' uncatastrophied fifth '735' of '4' grief of '90' '139''s drama.

But '63' '168', '447' c'118' of '967'ness, '6' fur'4'r c'336'aled in a '344' cunning disguise'508't, a desperate burglar slid '155' '90' '280' '179', '6' rob'515' '116' '34' of e'131''124'.

Upon '4' '422'ing of '7' fatal cork, '17'th flew '4' fi'398', '6' shrivelled up '90' '179'. Now, '17' prudent, '344' wise, '6' economic '385's, '4' '751'smith's shop '28' in '4' base'508't of '90' d'35'ing, '33' '31' a separate ent'868'ce to it; so '7' '194' '97' '4' '507' '6' loving healthy '362' '919'ened '31' no un'280' nervousness, '33' '31' vigorous plea'115', to '4' st'44' '847'ing of '49' '507'-armed '261' husb'6''s hammer; '94'se r'167'berations, muffled by '962'ing '209' '4' '983's '6' w'34's, '246' up to '49', '23' un'584'ly, in '49' nursery; '6' so, to st'44' Labor's iron lullaby, '4' '751'smith's infants '85' rocked to slumber.
Oh, woe on woe! Oh, D'545'h, '65' '51'st thou '23' so'559'imes be '75'ly? Hadst thou '645' '14' '261' '751'smith to thy'968' ere '90' '597' ruin '246' upon '58', '98' '97' '4' '507' widow '97' a delicious grief, '6' '49' orphans a truly vener'473', leg'398'ary '284'e to '710' of in '238' '180' '266'; '6' '34' of '116' a '324'e-'320'ing compe'606'cy.

CHAPTER 113. The Forge.

With matted beard, '6' swa'4'd in a bristling shark-skin apron, '39' mid-'183', Perth '28' st'6'ing '592'ween '90' '17'ge '6' anvil, '4' latter '226'd upon an iron-wood log, '31' '63' h'6' '956' a pike-'342' in '4' coals, '6' '31' '4' '173' at '90' '17'ge's lungs, '74' Captain Ahab '246' '549', '324'rying in '90' h'6' a sm'34' rusty-'262' lea'4'rn bag. While '332' a '105' distance '83' '4' '17'ge, moody Ahab pa'364'd; '773' at '181', Perth, '31'dra'768'g '90' iron '83' '4' '522', began hamme'847' it upon '4' anvil—'4' '796' m'652' '642'ing '141' '4' sparks in thick h'118'ing f'703's, '96' of '265' flew '452' to Ahab.
"Are '182' thy M'173' C'36'y's chickens, Perth? '69' '36' '194' f'666' in thy '830'; birds of '68' o'508', '111', '33' '23' to '34';—'73' '43', '69' burn; '33' thou—thou liv'st among '116' '327' a scorch."
"Beca'364' I am scorched '34' '118', Captain Ahab," '491'ed Perth, '426'ing '17' a mo'508't on '90' hammer; "I am '536' scorching; '23' easily '51''st thou scorch a s'324'."
"Well, '35'; no '117'. Thy sh'366'k '915' '602's '111' '804'ly, sanely woeful to me. In no Paradise '302', I am impatient of '34' misery in '173's '7' is '23' '721'. Thou '134''st go '721', '751'smith; '99', '65' dost thou '23' go '721'? How '51''st thou '398'ure '327' '213' '721'? Do '4' heavens '332' '413' '4'e, '7' thou '51''st '23' go '721'?—What wert thou '380' t'43'?"
"Welding an '261' pike-'342', '284'; t'43' '85' seams '6' dents in it."
"And '51''st thou '106' it '34' smooth '158', '751'smith, '180' '375' '321' usage as it '97'?"
"I '54' so, '284'."
"And I '803' thou '51''st smoo'4' al'344' '138' seams '6' dents; n'167' '241' '60' '321' '4' '559'al, '751'smith?"
"Aye, '284', I '54' I '51'; '34' seams '6' dents '33' '63'."
"Look ye '43', '98'," cried Ahab, '962'ionately advancing, '6' leaning '31' '312' '524' on Perth's '134'ers; "'73' ye '43'—'43'—'51' ye smoo'4' '44' a seam '46' '14', '751'smith," sweeping '63' h'6' across '90' rib'515' brow; "if thou '87''st, '751'smith, '431' '243' '72' I lay my '342' upon thy anvil, '6' '174' thy heaviest hammer '592'ween my '495'. Answer! Can'st thou smoo'4' '14' seam?"
"Oh! '7' is '4' '63', '284'! Said I '23' '34' seams '6' dents '33' '63'?"
"Aye, '751'smith, it is '4' '63'; aye, '128', it is unsmooth'473'; '17' '463' thou '146' '66''st it '43' in my flesh, it '129' '176'ed d'249' '155' '4' b'63' of my skull—'7' is '34' wrinkles! But, '170' '31' '497''s '412'; no '117' gaffs '6' pikes to-'183'. Look ye '43'!" jingling '4' lea'4'rn bag, as if it '85' '597' of g'261' coins. "I, '111', '53' a harpoon '721'e; '63' '7' a thous'6' yoke of fi'398's '87' '23' '348', Perth; so'559'hing '7' '76' '856' in a whale '46' '90' '249' fin-b'63'. T'43''s '4' '343'," flinging '4' pouch upon '4' anvil. "Look ye, '751'smith, '182' '36' '4' gat'43'd nail-stubbs of '4' steel shoes of racing horses."
"Horse-shoe stubbs, '284'? Why, Captain Ahab, thou '129't '43', '98', '4' '258' '6' stubbornest '343' we '751'smiths '167' '176'."
"I k'56' it, '261' '128'; '182' stubbs '76' weld to'42''49' '46' glue '83' '4' melted b'913' of '776'ers. Quick! '17'ge me '4' harpoon. And '17'ge me '171', twelve rods '17' '716' shank; '98' '768'd, '6' twist, '6' hammer '182' twelve to'42''49' '46' '4' yarns '6' str'6's of a tow-'518'. Quick! '82' blow '4' '522'."
When at '181' '4' twelve rods '85' '721'e, Ahab '457' '116', '63' by '63', by spir'34'ing '116', '31' '90' '249' h'6', round a '192', heavy iron bolt. "A f'749'!" rejecting '4' '181' '63'. "Work '7' '118' '158', Perth."
T'90' d'63', Perth '28' '39' to begin welding '4' twelve '155' '63', '74' Ahab '235'ed '90' h'6', '6' '136' he '72' weld '90' '249' iron. As, '98', '31' regular, gasping hems, he hamme'796' on '4' anvil, Perth '962'ing to '58' '4' glo'768'g rods, '63' '180' '4' '173', '6' '4' '321' pressed '17'ge '855'ing up '716' in'606'se '688' flame, '4' Par'66' '962'ed silently, '6' bo'768'g '118' '90' '342' to'869'ds '4' '522', '562'ed invoking '96' curse or '96' b'759'ing on '4' toil. But, as Ahab '720' up, he slid a'500'.
"What's '7' bunch of lucifers dodging '39' t'43' '17'?" mutte'796' Stubb, '262' on '83' '4' '17'ecastle. "That Par'66' smells '522' '46' a f'364'e; '6' smells of it '58''968', '46' a '576' musket's powder-pan."
At '181' '4' shank, in '63' comp'123'e rod, received '716' final h'545'; '6' as Perth, to temper it, plunged it '34' '90'sing '155' '4' c'257' of '604' '958' by, '4' scalding s'851' s'576' up '155' Ahab's bent '352'.
"Would'st thou br'6' me, Perth?" '768'cing '17' a mo'508't '31' '4' '684'; "'19' I '91' '33' '17'ging my '249' br'6'ing-iron, '98'?"
"Pray God, '23' '7'; '332' I fear so'559'hing, Captain Ahab. Is '23' '14' harpoon '17' '4' W'479'e Whale?"
"For '4' '691' fi'398'! But '56' '17' '4' '960'bs; thou '259' '106' '116' thy'968', '128'. Here '36' my razors—'4' '258' of steel; '43', '6' '106' '4' '960'bs sharp as '4' '107'le-sleet of '4' Icy Sea."
For a mo'508't, '4' '261' '751'smith '784'd '4' razors as '463' he '72' fain '23' '364' '116'.
"Take '116', '128', I '19' no '107' '17' '116'; '17' I '56' '948' s'19', sup, nor pray '773'—'33' '43'—to '176'!"
Fashi'63'd at '181' '155' an arrowy shape, '6' welded by Perth to '4' shank, '4' steel '358' '378'ed '4' '398' of '4' iron; '6' as '4' '751'smith '28' '39' '631' '4' '960'bs '238' final h'545', prior to tempe'847' '116', he cried to Ahab to '226' '4' '604'-c'257' '958'.
"No, no—no '604' '17' '7'; I '53' it of '4' '354' '548'-temper. Ahoy, t'43'! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What '99' ye, pagans! Will ye '145' me as '137' '593' as '76' c'118' '14' '960'b?" '956' it '530' up. A cluster of '967' nods rep'596'd, Yes. Three punctures '85' '721'e in '4' hea'98' flesh, '6' '4' W'479'e Whale's '960'bs '85' '98' tempe'796'.
"Ego non baptizo te in no'462' patris, sed in no'462' diaboli!" deliriously '60'led Ahab, as '4' malignant iron scorchingly dev'119'ed '4' baptismal '593'.
Now, '259'e'847' '4' sp'36' poles '83' below, '6' selecting '63' of hickory, '31' '4' '960'k s'773' investing it, Ahab fitted '4' '398' to '4' socket of '4' iron. A coil of '212' tow-'518' '28' '98' unwound, '6' '96' fathoms of it '645' to '4' '768'dl'652', '6' stretched to a '164' '606'sion. Pressing '90' foot upon it, '773' '4' rope hummed '46' a harp-st'847', '98' eagerly b'398'ing '118' it, '6' '66'ing no str'6'ings, Ahab exclaimed, "Good! '6' '56' '17' '4' seizings."
At '63' extremity '4' rope '28' unstr'6'ed, '6' '4' separate sp'504' yarns '85' '34' braided '6' woven round '4' socket of '4' harpoon; '4' pole '28' '98' '698'n '321' up '155' '4' socket; '83' '4' l'969'r '398' '4' rope '28' traced '499'-'103' '549' '4' pole's length, '6' firmly secu'796' so, '31' intertwistings of t'768'e. T'90' d'63', pole, iron, '6' rope—'46' '4' Three Fates—remained insepar'473', '6' Ahab moodily s'649' '170' '31' '4' weapon; '4' '602' of '90' ivory leg, '6' '4' '602' of '4' hickory pole, '312' hollowly '847'ing '549' e'131' '519'k. But ere he ente'796' '90' cabin, '703', unnatural, '499'-bante'847', '332' '344' piteous '602' '28' '299'. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle '33' un'426'ing '784'; '34' thy st'868'ge mummeries '23' un'80'ingly bl'398'ed '31' '4' '751' tragedy of '4' melancholy ship, '6' mocked it!




CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.

Penetrating fur'4'r '6' fur'4'r '155' '4' '374' of '4' Japanese cruising ground, '4' Pequod '28' '358' '34' astir in '4' fi'50'ry. Of'606', in mild, pleasant wea'4'r, '17' twelve, fifteen, '879'een, '6' t'277'y '520' on '4' stretch, '69' '85' engaged in '4' boats, steadily '732'ing, or sailing, or paddling '180' '4' whales, or '17' an interlude of '578'ty or s'140'ty '294's '804'ly a'483' '238' uprising; '463' '31' '33' sm'34' success '17' '238' '684's.
At '375' '464', '447' an abated sun; afloat '34' '183' upon smooth, slow heaving s'35's; s'545'ed in '90' boat, '703' as a birch '51'oe; '6' so sociably mixing '31' '4' soft waves '116'selves, '7' '46' '374'h-st'63' cats '69' purr '485' '4' '723'wale; '182' '36' '4' '464' of '710'y '935'ude, '74' be'956' '4' t'868'quil beauty '6' brilliancy of '4' ocean's skin, '63' '353's '4' tiger '374' '7' pants ben'545'h it; '6' '72' '23' '76'ingly '219', '7' '14' velvet paw '33' c'336'als a remorse'759' fang.
These '36' '4' '464', '74' in '90' whale-boat '4' r'118' softly '174's a '979' filial, confident, l'6'-'46' '174'ing to'869'ds '4' sea; '7' he regards it as so '137' fl'969'ry '987'; '6' '4' distant ship revealing '146' '4' '739's of '49' masts, '562's struggling '17''869'd, '23' '209' '530' rolling waves, '33' '209' '4' t'34' gr'652' of a rolling pr'769'ie: as '74' '4' western emig'868'ts' horses '146' s'60' '238' erected ears, '313' '238' hidden bo'474's widely wade '209' '4' '738' verdure.
The '192'-drawn virgin vales; '4' mild blue hill-'500's; as '118' '182' t'43' steals '4' hush, '4' hum; '1' al'344' '746' '7' '412'-'854'ied '566' '596' '503'ing in '182' solitudes, in '96' '431' May-'75', '74' '4' fl'969'rs of '4' woods '36' p'672'ed. And '34' '14' mixes '31' y'119' '344' mystic mood; so '7' '418' '6' fancy, '499'-'103' '381'ing, interpenetrate, '6' '17'm '63' seam'759' '251'.
Nor '64' '375' soo'124' scenes, '60''167' temporary, fail of at '402' as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if '182' '669' g'261'en keys '64' '562' to '422' in '58' '90' '249' '669' g'261'en treasuries, '332' '64' '90' br'545'h upon '116' '831' '33' tarnishing.
Oh, gr'652'y '431'es! oh, '167' vernal '398''759' l'6'scapes in '4' soul; in ye,—'463' '192' parched by '4' '314' drought of '4' '987'y '139',—in ye, '508' '332' '289' roll, '46' '507' horses in '212' '339' c'112'r; '6' '17' '96' '360' fleeting mo'508'ts, '174' '4' '494' dew of '4' '139' immortal on '116'. Would to God '182' b'759'ed '804's '72' '181'. But '4' mingled, mingling th'504's of '139' '36' woven by '869'p '6' woof: '804's crossed by storms, a storm '17' e'131' '804'. T'43' is no steady unretracing progress in '14' '139'; we do '23' advance '209' '950'ed gradations, '6' at '4' '181' '63' pa'364':—'209' infancy's unconscious spell, '311'hood's '147''759' faith, adolescence' doubt ('4' common doom), '98' scepticism, '98' disbe'596'f, '426'ing at '181' in '128'hood's ponde'847' repose of If. But '336' g'63' '209', we trace '4' round '158'; '6' '36' infants, '311's, '6' '508', '6' Ifs etern'34'y. W'43' '596's '4' final harbor, '74'ce we unmoor no '117'? In '11' rapt e'4'r sails '4' '296', of '265' '4' '854'iest '76' n'167' '854'y? W'43' is '4' '295'ling's '233' hidden? Our souls '36' '46' '200' orphans '94'se unwedded m'173's '474' in bea'847' '116': '4' '669' of '119' paternity '596's in '238' grave, '6' we '259' t'43' to '819' it.
And '7' '276' '183', '111', gazing '458' d'249' '83' '90' boat's '500' '155' '7' '276' g'261'en sea, Starbuck lowly murmu'796':—
"Love'518'ss unfathom'473', as '167' '112'r '282' in '90' '507' b'852''s '784'!—Tell me '23' of thy teeth-tie'796' sharks, '6' thy '428'napping '51'nibal '103's. Let faith oust '418'; '123' fancy oust memory; I '73' deep d'249' '6' do '172'."
And Stubb, fish-'46', '31' sparkling scales, leaped up in '7' '276' g'261'en '703':—
"I am Stubb, '6' Stubb '129' '90' '903'; '33' '43' Stubb '726' oaths '7' he '129' '194' '91' jolly!"




CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.

And jolly '243' '85' '4' sights '6' '4' '602's '7' '246' bea'847' d'249' '165' '4' '768'd, '96' '360' '731' '180' Ahab's harpoon '97' '91' welded.
It '28' a Nantucket ship, '4' Bachelor, '265' '97' '22' wedged in '49' '181' c'257' of oil, '6' bolted d'249' '49' bursting hatches; '6' '56', in '431' holi'183' app'36'l, '28' jo'1'sly, '463' '96''11' vain-gloriously, sailing round among '4' widely-separated ships on '4' ground, previous to '378'ing '49' prow '17' '179'.
The '291' '508' at '49' mast-'342' wore '192' streamers of narrow '796' bunting at '238' hats; '83' '4' stern, a whale-boat '28' susp'398'ed, bottom d'249'; '6' '621'ing captive '83' '4' bowsprit '28' '333' '4' '192' l'969'r jaw of '4' '181' whale '69' '97' slain.

As '14' '431' ship of '68' '672' bore d'249' upon '4' moody Pequod, '4' '960''960'ian '602' of enormous drums '246' '83' '49' '17'ecastle; '6' dra'768'g s'773' '958'er, a crowd of '49' '508' '85' '333' st'6'ing round '49' huge '244'-pots, '265', c'118'ed '31' '4' parch'508't-'46' poke or stomach skin of '4' '751' fish, '417' '17'th a loud roar to e'131' stroke of '4' clenched '524' of '4' crew.

Lord '6' master '118' '34' '14' scene, '4' captain s'111'd erect on '4' ship's elevated quarter-deck, so '7' '4' '251' rejoicing drama '28' '597' '165' '58', '6' '562'ed merely contrived '17' '90' '249' individual diversion.
And Ahab, he '111' '28' st'6'ing on '90' quarter-deck, shaggy '6' '751', '31' a stubborn gloom; '6' as '4' '149' ships crossed '356' '173''s '830's—'63' '34' jubilations '17' '124's '962'ed, '4' '173' '34' '17'ebodings as to '124's to '67'—'238' '149' captains in '116'selves im'369'ated '4' '251' striking contrast of '4' scene.
"Come aboard, '67' aboard!" cried '4' gay Bachelor's com'128'der, lifting a gl'652' '6' a bottle in '4' '769'.
"Hast '333' '4' W'479'e Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply.
"No; '146' '299' of '58'; '33' '21' '172' in '58' at '34'," '136' '4' '173' '68'-hu'117'dly. "Come aboard!"
"Thou art '111' '386'ed jolly. Sail on. Hast '387' '138' '508'?"
"Not '243' to '613' of—'149' isl'6'ers, '55' '34';—'33' '67' aboard, '261' '374'y, '67' '549'. '82' '358' '101' '7' '751' '83' y'119' brow. Come '549', '76' ye (merry's '4' '412'); a '597' ship '6' '179''869'd-bound."
"How wondrous familiar is a fool!" mutte'796' Ahab; '98' aloud, "Thou art a '597' ship '6' '179''869'd bound, thou '415't; '35', '98', c'34' me an empty ship, '6' '44''869'd-bound. So go thy '103's, '6' I '76' '462'. For'869'd t'43'! Set '34' sail, '6' '184' '49' to '4' '768'd!"
And thus, '313' '4' '63' ship '277' cheerily '165' '4' breeze, '4' '173' stubbornly fought '485' it; '6' so '4' '149' vessels '348'ed; '4' crew of '4' Pequod '262' '31' grave, linge'847' glances to'869'ds '4' receding Bachelor; '33' '4' Bachelor's '508' n'167' heeding '238' gaze '17' '4' '349'ly revelry '69' '85' in. And as Ahab, leaning '118' '4' taffrail, '784'd '4' '179''869'dbound craft, he '111'k '83' '90' pocket a sm'34' vial of s'6', '6' '98' '262' '83' '4' ship to '4' vial, '562'ed t'43'by b'847'ing '149' remote '652'ociations to'42''49', '17' '7' vial '28' filled '31' Nantucket '602'ings.




CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.

Not seldom in '14' '139', '74', on '4' '40' '500', '17'tune's fav'119'ites sail '452' by us, we, '463' '34' adroop '165', '756' '96''11' of '4' rushing breeze, '6' joy'597'y '174' '119' bagging sails fill '44'. So '562'ed it '31' '4' Pequod. For '290' '183' '180' en'893'e'847' '4' gay Bachelor, whales '85' '333' '6' '492' '85' slain; '6' '63' of '116' by Ahab.
It '28' '458' d'249' '4' '180'noon; '6' '74' '34' '4' spea'847's of '4' crim'273' '535' '85' d'63': '6' floating in '4' '112'ly sun'451' sea '6' sky, sun '6' whale '312' s'773'y '474'd to'42''49'; '98', '375' a '584'ness '6' '375' plaintiveness, '375' inwrea'124' ori'273's curled up in '7' rosy '769', '7' it al'344' '562'ed as if '458' '118' '83' '4' deep green convent v'34'eys of '4' Manilla isles, '4' Spanish l'6'-breeze, '53''146' '391'ed sailor, '97' g'63' to sea, fr'879'ed '31' '182' vesper hymns.
Soo'4'd '158', '33' '146' soo'4'd to deeper gloom, Ahab, '94' '97' sterned '141' '83' '4' whale, sat in'606'tly '763' '90' final wanings '83' '4' '56' t'868'quil boat. For '7' st'868'ge spectacle observ'473' in '34' sperm whales dying—'4' '391'ing sun'869'ds of '4' '342', '6' so expi'847'—'7' st'868'ge spectacle, beheld of '375' a placid '140'ing, '96''60' to Ahab conv'784'd a wondrousness un'677' '165'.
"He '391's '6' '391's '58' to it,—'60' slowly, '33' '60' stead'692'ly, '90' homage-r'398'e'847' '6' invoking brow, '31' '90' '181' dying motions. He '111' worships '522'; '344' faithful, b'937', '960'onial v'652'al of '4' sun!—Oh '7' '182' '111'-fav'119'ing '495' '134' '66' '182' '111'-fav'119'ing sights. Look! '43', '458' '604'-locked; beyond '34' hum of hu'128' weal or woe; in '182' '344' '51''64' '6' im'348'ial seas; w'43' to traditions no rocks furnish tab'123's; w'43' '17' '192' Chinese ages, '4' '899'ows '19' s'773' rolled on speech'759' '6' unspoken to, as stars '7' shine upon '4' Niger's un'677' s'119'ce; '43', '111', '139' '474's sun'869'ds '597' of faith; '33' '66'! no '358'er '314', '169' '548' whirls round '4' corpse, '6' it '342's '96' '173' '103'.
"Oh, thou '967' Hindoo '499' of nature, '94' of dr'249'ed b'913' '129't builded thy separate thr'63' '96'w'43' in '4' '374' of '182' unverdu'796' seas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, '6' '111' truly '613'est to me in '4' wide-slaughte'847' Typhoon, '6' '4' hu'50'd burial of '716' '180' '804'.

"Oh, trebly hooped '6' welded hip of '637'! Oh, '530' aspi'847', rainb'969'd jet!—'7' '63' strivest, '14' '63' jet'704' '34' in vain! In vain, oh whale, dost thou '66'k intercedings '31' yon '34'-quickening sun, '7' '146' c'34's '17'th '139', '33' '145's it '23' '158'. Yet dost thou, '967'er '499', rock me '31' a '896'er, if a '967'er faith. All thy unnam'473' imminglings float ben'545'h me '43'; I am buoyed by br'545'hs of '336' '565' '124's, exhaled as '769', '33' '604' '56'.
"Then hail, '17' '167' hail, O sea, in '94'se eternal tossings '4' wild fowl '156's '90' '146' '426'. Born of '987', '332' suckled by '4' sea; '463' hill '6' v'34'ey mot'43'd me, ye '899'ows '36' my foster-'411's!"




CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.

The '492' whales slain '7' '140'ing '97' '474'd wide a'348'; '63', '458' to '768'd'869'd; '63', '759' distant, to lee'869'd; '63' '531'; '63' astern. These '181' '291' '85' '561' '549''500' ere '168'f'34'; '33' '4' '768'd'869'd '63' '87' '23' be r'356'ed '773' '339'; '6' '4' boat '7' '97' '466' it lay by '716' '500' '34' '168'; '6' '7' boat '28' Ahab's.
The waif-pole '28' thrust up'40' '155' '4' '314' whale's sp'44'-hole; '6' '4' lantern '621'ing '83' '716' '739', cast a '461'd flicke'847' gl'36' upon '4' '751', glossy '78', '6' '458' '44' upon '4' mid'168' waves, '265' gently chafed '4' whale's b'937' flank, '46' soft surf upon a b'356'.
Ahab '6' '34' '90' boat's crew '562'ed a'503' '33' '4' Par'66'; '94' crouching in '4' bow, sat '763' '4' sharks, '7' spectr'34'y '412'ed round '4' whale, '6' tapped '4' '703' cedar '519'ks '31' '238' tails. A '602' '46' '4' moaning in squadrons '118' Asphaltites of un'17''145'n ghosts of Gomorrah, '868' shudde'847' '209' '4' '769'.
Started '83' '90' slumbers, Ahab, '352' to '352', '282' '4' Par'66'; '6' hooped round by '4' gloom of '4' '168' '69' '562'ed '4' '181' '508' in a flooded '296'. "I '19' '710'ed it '158'," '136' he.
"Of '4' '230'ses? Have I '23' '136', '261' '128', '7' '948' '230'se nor c'141'in '51' be thine?"
"And '94' '36' '230'sed '7' '474' on '4' sea?"
"But I '136', '261' '128', '7' ere thou '87'st '474' on '14' voyage, '149' '230'ses '259' verily be '333' by '4'e on '4' sea; '4' '171' '23' '721'e by mortal '524'; '6' '4' visible wood of '4' '181' '63' '259' be gr'249' in America."
"Aye, aye! a st'868'ge sight '7', Par'66':—a '230'se '6' '716' plumes floating '118' '4' ocean '31' '4' waves '17' '4' p'34'-be'36'rs. Ha! Such a sight we sh'34' '23' '358' '66'."
"Be'596've it or '23', thou '51'st '23' '474' '773' it be '333', '261' '128'."
"And '11' '28' '7' '99'ing '39' thy'968'?"
"Though it '67' to '4' '181', I sh'34' s'773' go '165' '4'e thy pi'202'."
"And '74' thou art so g'63' '165'—if '7' '167' bef'34'—'98' ere I '51' '858', thou '259' s'773' appear to me, to pi'202' me s'773'?—Was it '23' so? Well, '98', '64' I '172' '34' ye '99', oh my pi'202'! I '19' '43' '149' pledges '7' I sh'34' '332' slay Moby Dick '6' survive it."
"Take an'173' pledge, '261' '128'," '136' '4' Par'66', as '90' '495' '703'ed up '46' '522'-f'596's in '4' gloom—"Hemp '146' '51' '320' '4'e."
"The g'34'ows, ye '80'.—I am immortal '98', on l'6' '6' on sea," cried Ahab, '31' a laugh of derision;—"Immortal on l'6' '6' on sea!"
Both '85' silent '158', as '63' '128'. The grey dawn '246' on, '6' '4' slumbe'847' crew arose '83' '4' boat's bottom, '6' ere noon '4' '314' whale '28' '561' to '4' ship.




CHAPTER 118. The Quad'868't.

The sea'273' '17' '4' Line at length drew '958'; '6' e'131' '183' '74' Ahab, '260' '83' '90' cabin, cast '90' '495' aloft, '4' vigilant helms'128' '72' os'606'tatiously '627' '90' spokes, '6' '4' eager mariners quickly '366' to '4' braces, '6' '72' st'6' t'43' '31' '34' '238' '495' centr'34'y '950'ed on '4' nailed doubloon; impatient '17' '4' '619' to '378' '4' ship's prow '17' '4' equator. In '68' '75' '4' '619' '246'. It '28' '321' upon '530' noon; '6' Ahab, s'545'ed in '4' bows of '90' '530'-hoisted boat, '28' '39' '409' '90' wonted daily observation of '4' sun to deter'462' '90' latitude.
Now, in '7' Japanese sea, '4' '433' in summer '36' as fre'50'ts of effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun '562's '4' blazing focus of '4' gl'652'y ocean's immeasur'473' burning-gl'652'. The sky '388' lacque'796'; clouds t'43' '36' '697'; '4' horizon floats; '6' '14' nakedness of unre'596'ved radiance is as '4' insuffer'473' spl'398'ors of God's thr'63'. Well '7' Ahab's quad'868't '28' furni'50'd '31' col'119'ed gl'652'es, '209' '265' to '101' sight of '7' solar '522'. So, s'768'ging '90' s'545'ed '17'm to '4' roll of '4' ship, '6' '31' '90' astrological-'262' instru'508't '226'd to '90' '784', he remained in '7' posture '17' '96' mo'508'ts to '756' '4' precise instant '74' '4' sun '134' gain '716' precise meridian. Mean'75' '313' '90' '251' at'606'tion '28' absor'515', '4' Par'66' '28' kneeling ben'545'h '58' on '4' ship's deck, '6' '31' '352' '687'n up '46' Ahab's, '28' '784'ing '4' '276' sun '31' '58'; '146' '4' lids of '90' '495' '499' hooded '238' orbs, '6' '90' wild '352' '28' subdued to an '987'ly '962'ion'759'ness. At length '4' de'284'ed observation '28' '645'; '6' '31' '90' pencil upon '90' ivory leg, Ahab '358' calcu'399'd '11' '90' latitude '259' be at '7' precise instant. Then f'34'ing '155' a mo'508't's re'131', he '158' '720' up to'869'ds '4' sun '6' murmu'796' to '58''968': "Thou sea-mark! thou '530' '6' '240'y Pi'202'! thou '81'est me truly w'43' I am—'33' '51'st thou cast '4' '402' hint w'43' I sh'34' be? Or '51'st thou '81' w'43' '96' '173' '124' be'500's me is '14' mo'508't '565'? W'43' is Moby Dick? T'90' instant thou '259' be '784'ing '58'. These '495' of '462' '73' '155' '4' '131' '784' '7' is '140' '56' be'956' '58'; aye, '6' '155' '4' '784' '7' is '140' '56' equ'34'y be'956' '4' objects on '4' un'677', t'479''49' '500' of '4'e, thou sun!"
Then gazing at '90' quad'868't, '6' h'6'ling, '63' '180' '4' '173', '716' numerous caba'919'ical contrivances, he ponde'796' '158', '6' mutte'796': "Foolish toy! babies' '412''124' of haughty Admirals, '6' Commodores, '6' Captains; '4' '296' brags of '4'e, of thy cunning '6' '240'; '33' '11' '180' '34' '51'st thou do, '33' '81' '4' '719', pitiful '378', w'43' thou thy'968' '308'est to be on '14' wide '519'et, '6' '4' h'6' '7' '330's '4'e: no!

Curse '4'e, thou quad'868't!" dashing it to '4' deck, "no '192'er '76' I guide my '987'ly '103' by '4'e; '4' level ship's com'962', '6' '4' level '314'reckoning, by log '6' by '518'; '182' sh'34' conduct me, '6' s'60' me my '226' on '4' sea. Aye," '703'ing '83' '4' boat to '4' deck, "thus I trample on '4'e, thou pal'244' '124' '7' feebly '378'est on '530'; thus I split '6' destroy '4'e!"
As '4' f'868'tic '261' '128' thus spoke '6' thus trampled '31' '90' '349' '6' '314' '908', a snee'847' triumph '7' '562'ed '588' '17' Ahab, '6' a fata'919'ic desp'769' '7' '562'ed '588' '17' '58''968'—'182' '962'ed '118' '4' mute, motion'759' Par'66''s '352'. Unobserved he rose '6' glided '170'; '313', awestruck by '4' aspect of '238' com'128'der, '4' sea'508' cluste'796' to'42''49' on '4' '17'ecastle, '773' Ahab, '461'dly pacing '4' deck, sh'44'ed '44'—"To '4' braces! Up helm!—squ'36' in!"
In an instant '4' yards swung round; '6' as '4' ship '499'-wheeled upon '49' heel, '49' '291' firm-s'545'ed graceful masts erectly poised upon '49' '192', rib'515' hull, '562'ed as '4' '291' Horatii pirouetting on '63' sufficient steed.
St'6'ing '592'ween '4' k'168'-'342's, Starbuck '430'ed '4' Pequod's tumultuous '103', '6' Ahab's '516', as he '277' lurching '549' '4' deck.
"I '19' sat '165' '4' dense coal '522' '6' '430'ed it '34' aglow, '597' of '716' tor'508'ted flaming '139'; '6' I '19' '333' it wane at '181', d'249', d'249', to dum'258' dust. Old '128' of oceans! of '34' '14' fiery '139' of thine, '11' '76' at length remain '33' '63' '105' heap of a'50's!"
"Aye," cried Stubb, "'33' sea-coal a'50's—'241' ye '7', '197' Starbuck—sea-coal, '23' y'119' common charcoal. Well, '35'; I '299' Ahab mutter, 'Here '96' '63' thrusts '182' '324'ds '155' '182' '261' '524' of '462'; '746's '7' I '259' '412' '116', '6' no '173's.' And '386' me, Ahab, '33' thou '735'est '40'; '349' in '4' '544', '6' '474' in it!"




CHAPTER 119. The C'6'les.

Warmest climes '33' nurse '4' cruellest fangs: '4' tiger of '742'gal crouches in sp'972'd groves of cease'759' verdure. Skies '4' '344' effulgent '33' b'257'et '4' '314''596'st th'447's: gorgeous Cuba '359' torna'185' '7' n'167' swept tame nor'4'rn l'6's. So, '111', it is, '7' in '182' respl'398'ent Japanese seas '4' mariner en'893'ers '4' di'426' of '34' storms, '4' Typhoon. It '76' so'559'imes burst '83' '44' '7' cloud'759' sky, '46' an exploding bomb upon a dazed '6' '503'y t'249'.
To'869'ds '140'ing of '7' '183', '4' Pequod '28' torn of '49' '51'vas, '6' '960'e-poled '28' '269' to '535' a Typhoon '265' '97' struck '49' directly '531'. When '967'ness '246' on, sky '6' sea roa'796' '6' split '31' '4' th'447', '6' blazed '31' '4' '703'ning, '7' s'60'ed '4' dis'473'd masts flutte'847' '43' '6' t'43' '31' '4' rags '265' '4' '171' fury of '4' tempest '97' '269' '17' '716' '180' sport.
H'261'ing by a shroud, Starbuck '28' st'6'ing on '4' quarter-deck; at e'131' flash of '4' '703'ning glancing aloft, to '66' '11' additional disaster '240' '19' bef'34'en '4' intricate hamper t'43'; '313' Stubb '6' Fl'257' '85' directing '4' '508' in '4' '530'er hoisting '6' firmer lashing of '4' boats. But '34' '238' '684's '562'ed naught. Though lifted to '4' '131' '739' of '4' c'868'es, '4' '768'd'869'd quarter boat (Ahab's) '64' '23' escape. A '164' rolling sea, dashing '530' up '485' '4' reeling ship's '530' teete'847' '500', stove in '4' boat's bottom at '4' stern, '6' '269' it '158', '34' dripping '209' '46' a sieve.
"Bad '176', '217' '176'! '197' Starbuck," '136' Stubb, regarding '4' wreck, "'33' '4' sea '76' '19' '716' '103'. Stubb, '17' '63', '51''t '535' it. You '66', '197' Starbuck, a wave '129' '375' a '164' '192' '319' '165' it leaps, '34' round '4' '296' it '366's, '6' '98' '67's '4' sp'847'! But as '17' me, '34' '4' '319' I '19' to '381' it, is '22' across '4' deck '43'. But n'167' '241'; '30' '34' in '427': so '4' '261' '273'g '415';"—(sings.)
  Oh! jolly is '4' gale,
  And a joker is '4' whale,
  A' fl'119'ishin' '90' tail,—
  Such a '427'ny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is '4' Ocean, oh!

  The scud '34' a flyin',
  That's '90' flip '146' foamin';
  When he stirs in '4' spicin',—
  Such a '427'ny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is '4' Ocean, oh!

  Th'447' spl'716' '4' ships,
  But he '146' smacks '90' lips,
  A tastin' of '14' flip,—
  Such a '427'ny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is '4' Ocean, oh!
"Avast Stubb," cried Starbuck, "'123' '4' Typhoon sing, '6' strike '90' harp '43' in '119' rigging; '33' if thou art a brave '128' thou wilt '330' thy peace."
"But I am '23' a brave '128'; n'167' '136' I '28' a brave '128'; I am a co'869'd; '6' I sing to '184' up my spir'716'. And I '81' '1' '11' it is, '197' Starbuck, t'43''s no '103' to '188' my singing in '14' '296' '33' to '537' my throat. And '74' '55' d'63', '606' to '63' I sing ye '4' doxology '17' a '768'd-up."
"Mad'128'! '73' '209' my '495' if thou '129't '697' of thine '249'."
"What! '60' '51' '1' '66' '166' of a '967' '168' '169' '138''618' '234', n'167' '241' '60' foolish?"
"Here!" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by '4' '134'er, '6' '378'ing '90' h'6' to'869'ds '4' wea'4'r bow, "markest thou '23' '7' '4' gale '67's '83' '4' east'869'd, '4' '131' '239' Ahab is to '366' '17' Moby Dick?

Now jump '118'board, '6' sing '170', if thou '259'!
"I '21' '499' '447'st'6' ye: '11''s in '4' '768'd?"
"Yes, '89', round '4' Cape of Good Hope is '4' '940'est '103' to Nantucket," soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heed'759' of Stubb's '455'. "The gale '7' '56' hammers at us to stave us, we '51' '391' it '155' a '807' '768'd '7' '76' '698' us to'869'ds '179'. Yonder, to '768'd'869'd, '34' is '751'ness of doom; '33' to lee'869'd, '179''869'd—I '66' it ligh'606's up t'43'; '33' '23' '31' '4' '703'ning."
At '7' mo'508't in '63' of '4' intervals of pro'295' '967'ness, '858'ing '4' fla'50's, a '915' '28' '299' at '90' '500'; '6' al'344' at '4' '276' instant a volley of th'447' peals rolled '118''342'.
"Who's t'43'?"
"Old Th'447'!" '136' Ahab, groping '90' '103' '549' '4' bul'869'ks to '90' pivot-hole; '33' suddenly '156'ing '90' path '721'e plain to '58' by elb'969'd lances of '522'.
Now, as '4' '703'ning rod to a spire on shore is in'606'ded to '324'ry '141' '4' perilous fluid '155' '4' soil; so '4' '207''796' rod '265' at sea '96' ships '324'ry to '356' mast, is in'606'ded to conduct it '155' '4' '604'. But as '14' conductor '259' desc'398' to con'500'r'473' depth, '7' '716' '398' '289' avoid '34' cont'735' '31' '4' hull; '6' as '117''118', if '764' constantly to'768'g t'43', it '72' be li'473' to '128'y mishaps, be'500's interfe'847' '23' a '105' '31' '96' of '4' rigging, '6' '117' or '759' impeding '4' vessel's '103' in '4' '604'; beca'364' of '34' '14', '4' l'969'r '348's of a ship's '703'ning-rods '36' '23' '194' '118'board; '33' '36' gener'34'y '721'e in '192' sl'398'er links, so as to be '4' '117' '504'ily hauled up '155' '4' chains '44''500', or '687'n d'249' '155' '4' sea, as occasion '289' require.
"The rods! '4' rods!" cried Starbuck to '4' crew, suddenly admoni'50'd to vigilance by '4' vivid '703'ning '7' '97' '22' '91' darting flambeaux, to '703' Ahab to '90' post. "Are '69' '118'board? '705' '116' '118', '17'e '6' aft. Quick!"
"Avast!" cried Ahab; "'123''s '19' '807' '412' '43', '463' we be '4' weaker '500'. Yet '82' contri'33'e to raise rods on '4' Himmalehs '6' Andes, '7' '34' '4' '296' '289' be secu'796'; '33' '44' on privileges! Let '116' be, '284'."
"Look aloft!" cried Starbuck. "The corpusants! '4' corpusants!"
All '4' yard-arms '85' tipped '31' a p'34'id '522'; '6' '678'ed at '356' tri-'378'ed '703'ning-rod-'398' '31' '291' '890''847' '691' flames, '356' of '4' '291' t'34' masts '28' silently burning in '7' sulphurous '769', '46' '291' gigantic wax '890'rs '165' an altar.
"B'181' '4' boat! '123' it go!" cried Stubb at '14' instant, as a s'28'hing sea heaved up '447' '90' '249' '105' craft, so '7' '716' '723'wale violently jammed '90' h'6', as he '28' '962'ing a lashing. "B'181' it!"—'33' slipping '78''869'd on '4' deck, '90' uplifted '495' '808' '4' flames; '6' immediately shifting '90' t'63' he cried—"The corpusants '19' mercy on us '34'!"
To sailors, oaths '36' ho'364''330' '429's; '69' '76' '746' in '4' t'868'ce of '4' '804', '6' in '4' teeth of '4' tempest; '69' '76' imprecate curses '83' '4' '739'sail-yard-arms, '74' '344' '69' teeter '118' to a '66''124' sea; '33' in '34' my voyagings, seldom '19' I '299' a common oath '74' God's burning finger '129' '91' laid on '4' ship; '74' His "Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin" '129' '91' woven '155' '4' shrouds '6' '4' cordage.
While '14' p'34'idness '28' burning aloft, '360' '429's '85' '299' '83' '4' enchanted crew; '94' in '63' thick cluster s'111'd on '4' '17'ecastle, '34' '238' '495' gleaming in '7' pale phosphorescence, '46' a '458' '170' cons'81'ation of stars. Re'596'ved '485' '4' ghostly '703', '4' gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thr'972' '90' '272' stature, '6' '562'ed '4' '751' cloud '83' '265' '4' th'447' '97' '67'. The '348'ed '843' of Tashtego revealed '90' shark-'691' teeth, '265' st'868'gely gleamed as if '69' '111' '97' '91' tipped by corpusants; '313' lit up by '4' preternatural '703', Queequeg's tat'111'ing burned '46' Satanic blue flames on '90' '618'.
The t'473'au '34' waned at '181' '31' '4' p'34'idness aloft; '6' '336' '117' '4' Pequod '6' e'131' soul on '49' decks '85' wrapped in a p'34'. A mo'508't or '149' '962'ed, '74' Starbuck, '45' '17''869'd, pu'50'd '485' '96' '63'. It '28' Stubb. "What '54'est thou '56', '128'; I '299' thy cry; it '28' '23' '4' '276' in '4' '273'g."
"No, no, it '237'; I '136' '4' corpusants '19' mercy on us '34'; '6' I '274' '69' '76', s'773'. But do '69' '146' '19' mercy on '192' '352's?—'19' '69' no b'969'ls '17' a laugh? And '73' ye, '197' Starbuck—'33' '30' '111' '967' to '73'. Hear me, '98': I '101' '7' mast-'342' flame we '282' '17' a '659' of '68' '672'; '17' '200' masts '36' rooted in a '330' '7' is '45' to be chock a' block '31' sperm-oil, d'ye '66'; '6' so, '34' '7' sperm '76' '176' up '155' '4' masts, '46' sap in a tree. Yes, '119' '291' masts '76' '332' be as '291' spermaceti '51'dles—'55' '4' '68' '449' we '282'."
At '7' mo'508't Starbuck '808' sight of Stubb's '352' slowly beginning to glimmer '155' sight. Glancing up'869'ds, he cried: "See! '66'!" '6' '336' '117' '4' '530' '890''847' flames '85' beheld '31' '11' '562'ed '796'oubled supernaturalness in '238' p'34'or.
"The corpusants '19' mercy on us '34'," cried Stubb, '158'.
At '4' base of '4' mainmast, '597' ben'545'h '4' doubloon '6' '4' flame, '4' Par'66' '28' kneeling in Ahab's '569', '33' '31' '90' '342' b'969'd '170' '83' '58'; '313' '958' by, '83' '4' arched '6' '118''621'ing rigging, w'43' '69' '97' '22' '91' engaged secu'847' a spar, a '539' of '4' sea'508', ar'426'ed by '4' gl'36', '56' co'43'd to'42''49', '6' hung p'398'ulous, '46' a k'23' of num'515' '28'ps '83' a drooping, orc'321' twig. In various enchanted attitudes, '46' '4' st'6'ing, or '761'ping, or '573' ske'123'ons in Herculaneum, '173's remained rooted to '4' deck; '33' '34' '238' '495' upcast.
"Aye, aye, '508'!" cried Ahab. "Look up at it; mark it '35'; '4' '691' flame '33' '703's '4' '103' to '4' W'479'e Whale! H'6' me '200' mainmast links t'43'; I '72' fain '174' '14' pulse, '6' '123' '462' '942' '485' it; '593' '485' '522'! So."
Then '391'ing—'4' '181' link held '692' in '90' '269' h'6', he '186' '90' foot upon '4' Par'66'; '6' '31' '950'ed up'869'd '784', '6' '530'-flung '40' arm, he s'111'd erect '165' '4' lofty tri-'378'ed trinity of flames.
"Oh! thou '574' spirit of '574' '522', '94'm on '182' seas I as Persian '336' '64' worship, '773' in '4' sacra'508'tal '735' so burned by '4'e, '7' to '14' '612' I bear '4' s'324'; I '56' k'56' '4'e, thou '574' spirit, '6' I '56' k'56' '7' thy '40' worship is defiance.

[Sudden, rep'545'ed fla'50's of '703'ning; '4' nine flames leap lengthwise to thr'972' '238' previous h'879'; Ahab, '31' '4' '426', '452's '90' '495', '90' '40' h'6' pressed '321' upon '116'.]
"I '249' thy speech'759', '226''759' '637'; '136' I '23' so? Nor '28' it w'366'g '83' me; nor do I '56' '705' '182' links. Thou '51'st blind; '33' I '51' '98' grope.

Through '4'e, thy flaming '968', my scorched '495' do dimly '66' it. Oh, thou '295'ling '522', thou '49'mit immemorial, thou '111' '129't thy incommunic'473' riddle, thy un'348'icipated grief. Here '158' '31' haughty '414'ny, I '504' my '284'e. Leap! leap up, '6' lick '4' sky! I leap '31' '4'e; I burn '31' '4'e; '72' fain be welded '31' '4'e; defyingly I worship '4'e!"
"The boat! '4' boat!" cried Starbuck, "'73' at thy boat, '261' '128'!"
Ahab's harpoon, '4' '63' '17'ged at Perth's '522', remained firmly la'50'd in '716' conspicuous crotch, so '7' it projected beyond '90' whale-boat's bow; '33' '4' sea '7' '97' stove '716' bottom '97' ca'364'd '4' loose lea'4'r '50'ath to '705' '141'; '6' '83' '4' keen steel '960'b t'43' '56' '246' a levelled flame of pale, '17'ked '522'. As '4' silent harpoon burned t'43' '46' a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by '4' arm—"God, God is '485' '4'e, '261' '128'; '17'bear! 'tis an ill voyage! ill be'723', ill continued; '123' me squ'36' '4' yards, '313' we '289', '261' '128', '6' '106' a '807' '768'd of it '179''869'ds, to go on a '166' voyage '169' '14'."
Overhea'847' Starbuck, '4' panic-stricken crew instantly '868' to '4' braces—'463' '23' a sail '28' '269' aloft. For '4' mo'508't '34' '4' ag'129't mate's '147's '562'ed '238's; '69' raised a '499' mutinous cry. But dashing '4' rattling '703'ning links to '4' deck, '6' snatching '4' burning harpoon, Ahab waved it '46' a torch among '116'; '746'ing to t'868's'950' '31' it '4' '171' sailor '7' '33' cast loose a rope's '398'. Petrified by '90' aspect, '6' s'773' '117' shrinking '83' '4' fiery dart '7' he held, '4' '508' '947' '78' in dis'289', '6' Ahab '158' spoke:—
"All y'119' oaths to hunt '4' W'479'e Whale '36' as binding as '462'; '6' '374', soul, '6' '618', lungs '6' '139', '261' Ahab is bound. And '7' ye '289' k'56' to '11' tune '14' '374' '942's; '73' ye '43'; thus I blow '44' '4' '181' fear!" And '31' '63' b'181' of '90' br'545'h he extingui'50'd '4' flame.
As in '4' hurri'51'e '7' sweeps '4' plain, '508' fly '4' neighborhood of '96' l'63', gigantic elm, '94'se '131' h'879' '6' strength '33' r'398'er it so '137' '4' '117' un'564', beca'364' so '137' '4' '117' a mark '17' th'447'bolts; so at '200' '181' '429's of Ahab's '128'y of '4' mariners '64' '366' '83' '58' in a terror of dis'289'.




CHAPTER 120. The Deck To'869'ds '4' End of '4' First Night Watch.

Ahab st'6'ing by '4' helm. Starbuck approaching '58'.

"We '259' '642' d'249' '4' main-'739'-sail yard, '284'. The b'6' is '406' loose '6' '4' lee lift is '499'-str'6'ed. Sh'34' I strike it, '284'?"
"Strike no'124'; lash it. If I '97' sky-sail poles, '190' s'103' '116' up '56'."
"Sir!—in God's '275'!—'284'?"
"Well."
"The anchors '36' '406', '284'. Sh'34' I '42' '116' inboard?"
"Strike no'124', '6' stir no'124', '33' lash e'131''124'. The '768'd rises, '33' it '129' '23' '61' up to my t'473'-l'6's '332'. Quick, '6' '66' to it.—By masts '6' keels! he '726' me '17' '4' hunch-'78'ed skipper of '96' coasting smack. S'398' d'249' my main-'739'-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks '85' '721'e '17' wildest '768'ds, '6' '14' brain-truck of '462' '56' sails amid '4' cloud-scud. Sh'34' I strike '7'? Oh, '697' '33' co'869'ds '642' d'249' '238' brain-trucks in tempest '75'. What a hooroosh aloft t'43'! I '72' e'en '101' it '17' sublime, '64' I '23' k'56' '7' '4' colic is a noisy ma'614'. Oh, '101' medicine, '101' medicine!"




CHAPTER 121. Mid'168'.—The Forecastle Bul'869'ks.

Stubb '6' Fl'257' mounted on '116', '6' '962'ing additional lashings '118' '4' anchors t'43' '621'ing.
"No, Stubb; '1' '289' pound '7' k'23' t'43' as '137' as '1' '142', '33' '1' '76' n'167' pound '155' me '11' '1' '85' '22' '56' '99'ing. And '60' '192' '414' is it '317' '1' '136' '4' '131' contrary? Didn't '1' '336' '99' '7' w'413'ver ship Ahab sails in, '7' ship '134' '490' so'559'hing extra on '716' insu'868'ce policy, '22' as '463' it '85' loaded '31' powder '960'rels aft '6' '990'es of lucifers '17''869'd? S'739', '56'; '64'n't '1' '99' so?"
"Well, '803' I '64'? What '98'? '114' '348' '397'd my flesh '317' '7' '75', '65' '23' my '241'? Be'500's, supposing we '36' loaded '31' powder '960'rels aft '6' lucifers '17''869'd; '60' '4' d'779' '87' '4' lucifers '42' a'522' in '14' drenching spray '43'? Why, my '105' '128', '1' '19' '281' '796' h'769', '33' '1' '87'n't '42' a'522' '56'. Shake y'119''968'; '41' Aquarius, or '4' '604'-be'36'r, Fl'257'; '240' fill pitc'49's at y'119' coat collar. Don't '1' '66', '98', '7' '17' '182' extra risks '4' Marine Insu'868'ce companies '19' extra gua'868'tees? Here '36' hyd'868'ts, Fl'257'. But hark, '158', '6' '82' '491' ye '4' '173' '124'. First '101' y'119' leg '141' '83' '4' cr'249' of '4' anchor '43', '463', so I '51' '962' '4' rope; '56' '919'en. What's '4' '240'y difference '592'ween '956' a mast's '703'ning-rod in '4' storm, '6' st'6'ing '452' by a mast '7' '129'n't '61' '138' '703'ning-rod at '34' in a storm? Don't '1' '66', '1' timber-'342', '7' no harm '51' '67' to '4' '330'er of '4' rod, un'759' '4' mast is '171' struck? What '36' '1' '150'ing '39', '98'? Not '63' ship in a hund'796' '324'ries rods, '6' Ahab,—aye, '128', '6' '34' of us,—'85' in no '117' danger '98', in my '719' opinion, '169' '34' '4' crews in '606' thous'6' ships '56' sailing '4' seas. Why, '1' King-Post, '1', I '803' '1' '72' '19' e'131' '128' in '4' '296' go '39' '31' a sm'34' '703'ning-rod '573' up '4' corner of '90' hat, '46' a militia '493'r's skewe'796' fea'4'r, '6' trailing '528' '46' '90' sash. Why '21' ye be sensible, Fl'257'? '30' '454' to be sensible; '65' '21' ye, '98'? '138' '128' '31' '499' an '784' '51' be sensible."
"I '21' k'56' '7', Stubb. You so'559'imes '156' it '743' '321'."
"Yes, '74' a '947'ow's soaked '209', '30' '321' to be sensible, '55' a '418'. And I am '39' drenched '31' '14' spray. N'167' '241'; '756' '4' '391' t'43', '6' '962' it. Seems to me we '36' lashing d'249' '182' anchors '56' as if '69' '85' n'167' '45' to be '364'd '158'. Tying '182' '149' anchors '43', Fl'257', '562's '46' tying a '128''s '524' '528' '58'. And '11' '201' generous '524' '69' '36', to be '115'. These '36' y'119' iron fists, '84'? What a '330' '69' '19', '111'! I '683', Fl'257', whe'4'r '4' '296' is ancho'796' '138'w'43'; if '50' is, '50' s'768'gs '31' an uncommon '192' c'473', '463'. T'43', hammer '7' k'23' d'249', '6' '309' d'63'. So; '290' to '678'ing l'6', '703'ing on deck is '4' '344' satis'418'ory. I '99', '22' w'847' '44' my jacket skirts, '76' ye? Thank ye. T'84' laugh at '192'-togs so, Fl'257'; '33' '562's to me, a Long tailed coat ought '194' to be worn in '34' storms afloat. The tails '890''847' d'249' '7' '103', serve to '324'ry '141' '4' '604', d'ye '66'. '469'e '31' cocked hats; '4' cocks '17'm g'473'-'398' eave-troughs, Fl'257'. No '117' monkey-jackets '6' tarpaulins '17' me; I '259' mount a sw'34'ow-tail, '6' '698' d'249' a beaver; so. H'34'oa! whew! t'43' '547' my tarpaulin '118'board; Lord, Lord, '7' '4' '768'ds '7' '67' '83' heaven '134' be so un'128'nerly! T'90' is a nasty '168', lad."




CHAPTER 122. Mid'168' Aloft.—Th'447' '6' Lightning.

The main-'739'-sail yard.—Tashtego '962'ing '212' lashings '187' it.
"Um, um, um. S'739' '7' th'447'! Plenty '111' '137' th'447' up '43'. What's '4' '364' of th'447'? Um, um, um. We '21' '53' th'447'; we '53' rum; '145' us a gl'652' of rum. Um, um, um!"




CHAPTER 123. The Musket.

Du'847' '4' '344' violent shocks of '4' Typhoon, '4' '128' at '4' Pequod's jaw-b'63' '773'er '97' s'167'al '464' '91' reelingly hurled to '4' deck by '716' spasmodic motions, '140' '463' pr'140'ter tackles '97' '91' attached to it—'17' '69' '85' slack—beca'364' '96' '412' to '4' '773'er '28' indispens'473'.
In a s'167'e gale '46' '14', '313' '4' ship is '33' a tossed '472'tlecock to '4' b'181', it is by no '410' uncommon to '66' '4' '107'les in '4' com'962'es, at intervals, go round '6' round. It '28' thus '31' '4' Pequod's; at al'344' e'131' shock '4' helms'128' '97' '23' failed to '23''972' '4' whirling velo'709' '31' '265' '69' revolved upon '4' '324'ds; it is a sight '7' '321'ly '138''63' '51' be'330' '327' '96' '563' of unwonted emotion.
Some '520' '180' mid'168', '4' Typhoon abated so '137', '7' '209' '4' strenuous exertions of Starbuck '6' Stubb—'63' engaged '17''869'd '6' '4' '173' aft—'4' shive'796' remnants of '4' jib '6' '17'e '6' main-'739'-sails '85' '537' adrift '83' '4' spars, '6' '277' eddying '170' to lee'869'd, '46' '4' fea'4'rs of an albatross, '265' so'559'imes '36' cast to '4' '768'ds '74' '7' storm-tossed bird is on '4' '768'g.
The '291' corresponding '212' sails '85' '56' bent '6' reefed, '6' a storm-'244'sail '28' '451' fur'4'r aft; so '7' '4' ship '358' '277' '209' '4' '604' '31' '96' precision '158'; '6' '4' '239'—'17' '4' '986', East-s'44'h-east—'265' he '28' to steer, if pr'735'ic'473', '28' '336' '117' '145'n to '4' helms'128'. For du'847' '4' violence of '4' gale, he '97' '146' stee'796' according to '716' vicis'421'udes. But as he '28' '56' b'847'ing '4' ship as '958' '49' '239' as '622', '763' '4' com'962' '80''313', lo! a '68' '659'! '4' '768'd '562'ed '260' round astern; aye, '4' foul breeze be'246' '807'!
Instantly '4' yards '85' squa'796', to '4' '349'ly '273'g of "Ho! '4' '807' '768'd! oh-ye-ho, cheerly '508'!" '4' crew singing '17' joy, '7' so promising an '140't '134' so '358' '19' falsified '4' '779' por'606'ts preceding it.
In compliance '31' '4' st'6'ing '619' of '90' com'128'der—to report immediately, '6' at '138' '63' of '4' t'277'y-'492' '520', '138' '750' '397' in '4' af'807's of '4' deck,—Starbuck '97' no '358'er trimmed '4' yards to '4' breeze—'60''167' reluctantly '6' gloomily,—'169' he mechanic'34'y '277' below to apprise Captain Ahab of '4' circumstance.
Ere knocking at '90' '892'-'267', he involuntarily pa'364'd '165' it a mo'508't. The cabin lamp—'409' '192' s'768'gs '14' '103' '6' '7'—'28' burning fit'597'y, '6' casting fitful s'97'ows upon '4' '261' '128''s bolted '450',—a thin '63', '31' '950'ed blinds inserted, in '226' of upper panels. The iso'399'd subter'868'eousness of '4' cabin '721'e a '979' humming silence to reign t'43', '463' it '28' hooped round by '34' '4' roar of '4' ele'508'ts. The loaded muskets in '4' rack '85' shiningly revealed, as '69' s'111'd up'40' '485' '4' '17''869'd bulk'342'. Starbuck '28' an h'913't, up'40' '128'; '33' '44' of Starbuck's '374', at '7' instant '74' he '282' '4' muskets, t'43' st'868'gely evolved an '779' '147'; '33' so blent '31' '716' neutral or '68' accompani'508'ts '7' '17' '4' instant he '321'ly k'212' it '17' '716'elf.
"He '72' '19' s'576' me '336'," he murmu'796', "'89', t'43''s '4' '131' musket '7' he '378'ed at me;—'7' '63' '31' '4' studded stock; '123' me '678' it—lift it. St'868'ge, '7' I, '94' '19' '627'd so '128'y '314'ly lances, st'868'ge, '7' I '134' shake so '56'. Loaded? I '259' '66'. Aye, aye; '6' powder in '4' pan;—'55' '23' '68'. Best spill it?—'154'. '82' cure '302' of '14'. '82' '330' '4' musket b'261'ly '313' I '54'.—I '67' to report a '807' '768'd to '58'. But '60' '807'? F'769' '17' '548' '6' doom,—'55' '807' '17' Moby Dick. It's a '807' '768'd '55' '146' '807' '17' '7' accursed fish.—The '131' tube he '378'ed at me!—'4' '131' '63'; '14' '63'—I '330' it '43'; he '72' '19' '466' me '31' '4' '131' '124' I '627' '56'.—Aye '6' he '72' fain '320' '34' '90' crew. Does he '23' '99' he '76' '23' strike '90' spars to '138' gale? Has he '23' da'50'd '90' heavenly quad'868't? '6' in '182' '276' perilous seas, gropes he '23' '90' '103' by mere '314' reckoning of '4' error-abounding log? '6' in '14' '131' Typhoon, '64' he '23' '746' '7' he '72' '19' no '703'ning-rods? But sh'34' '14' crazed '261' '128' be tamely suffe'796' to drag a '251' ship's '624' d'249' to doom '31' '58'?—Yes, it '72' '106' '58' '4' wilful '776'er of thirty '508' '6' '117', if '14' ship '67' to '138' '314'ly harm; '6' '67' to '314'ly harm, my soul '746's '14' ship '76', if Ahab '19' '90' '103'. If, '98', he '85' '14' instant—'186' a'500', '7' crime '72' '23' be '90'. Ha! is he mutte'847' in '90' '503'? Yes, '22' t'43',—in t'43', '86' '503'ing. Sleeping? aye, '33' s'773' a'349', '6' '358' a'830' '158'. I '51''t '31'st'6' '4'e, '98', '261' '128'.

Say he '85' pini'63'd '140'; k'23'ted '34' '118' '31' ropes '6' hawsers; chained d'249' to '847'-bolts on '14' cabin '983'; he '72' be '117' hideous '169' a caged tiger, '98'.

I st'6' al'63' '43' upon an '422' sea, '31' '149' oceans '6' a '251' continent '592'ween me '6' '749'.—Aye, aye, 'tis so.—Is heaven a '776'er '74' '716' '703'ning strikes a '72'-be '776'er in '90' '515', tinde'847' '50'ets '6' skin to'42''49'?—And '72' I be a '776'er, '98', if"—'6' slowly, stealthily, '6' '499' '500''103's '262', he '226'd '4' loaded musket's '398' '485' '4' '450'.

Such '85' '4' '602's '7' '56' '246' '310'ling '83' '44' '4' '261' '128''s tor'508'ted '503', as if Starbuck's '915' '97' ca'364'd '4' '192' dumb '710' to '613'.
The '332' levelled musket shook '46' a d'366'kard's arm '485' '4' panel; Starbuck '562'ed w'426'ling '31' an angel; '33' '391'ing '83' '4' '450', he '226'd '4' '548'-tube in '716' rack, '6' '269' '4' '226'.
"He's '111' '602' a'503', '197' Stubb; go thou d'249', '6' '830' '58', '6' '81' '58'. I '259' '66' to '4' deck '43'. Thou k'56''st '11' to '99'."




CHAPTER 124. The Needle.

Next '339' '4' '23'-'332'-sub'500'd sea rolled in '192' slow '899'ows of '240'y bulk, '6' striving in '4' Pequod's gurgling track, pu'50'd '49' on '46' giants' palms '44'sp'504'. The '777', unstagge'847' breeze abounded so, '7' sky '6' '769' '562'ed vast '44'bel'666' sails; '4' '251' '296' boomed '165' '4' '768'd. Muffled in '4' '597' '339' '703', '4' invisible sun '28' '146' '677' by '4' sp'504' in'606''421'y of '90' '226'; w'43' '90' bay'63't rays '367'd on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of cr'249'ed Babylonian kings '6' queens, reigned '118' e'131''124'. The sea '28' as a crucible of mol'606' g'261', '7' bubblingly leaps '31' '703' '6' h'545'.
Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab s'111'd a'348'; '6' e'131' '75' '4' tete'847' ship l'969''847'ly pitched d'249' '49' bowsprit, he '391'ed to '784' '4' b'40' sun's rays produced '531'; '6' '74' '50' pro'295'ly '451'tled by '4' stern, he '391'ed '528', '6' '282' '4' sun's rear'869'd '226', '6' '60' '4' '276' yellow rays '85' bl'398'ing '31' '90' undeviating '830'.
"Ha, ha, my ship! thou '240'est '35' be '645' '56' '17' '4' sea-chariot of '4' sun. Ho, ho! '34' ye nations '165' my prow, I b'847' '4' sun to ye! Yoke on '4' fur'4'r '899'ows; h'34'o! a t'6'em, I '698' '4' sea!"
But suddenly reined '78' by '96' '893'er '147', he hurried to'869'ds '4' helm, huskily de'128'ding '60' '4' ship '28' '342'ing.
"East-sou-east, '284'," '136' '4' frigh'606'ed steers'128'.
"Thou '596'st!" smiting '58' '31' '90' clenched fist. "Heading East at '14' '612' in '4' '339', '6' '4' sun astern?"
Upon '14' e'131' soul '28' con'295'ed; '17' '4' pheno'508'on '22' '98' observed by Ahab '97' unac'893'ably escaped e'131' '63' '234'; '33' '716' '131' blinding palp'473'ness '259' '19' '91' '4' ca'364'.
Thrusting '90' '342' '499' '103' '155' '4' binnacle, Ahab '808' '63' glimpse of '4' com'962'es; '90' uplifted arm slowly '947'; '17' a mo'508't he al'344' '562'ed to stagger. St'6'ing '528' '58' Starbuck '720', '6' lo! '4' '149' com'962'es '378'ed East, '6' '4' Pequod '28' as inf'34'ibly '45' West.
But ere '4' '171' wild alarm '87' '42' '44' ab'937' among '4' crew, '4' '261' '128' '31' a rigid laugh exclaimed, "I '19' it! It '129' '203' '165'. '197' Starbuck, '181' '168''s th'447' '391'ed '119' com'962'es—'55' '34'. Thou '129't '165' '56' '299' of '375' a '124', I '101' it."
"Aye; '33' n'167' '165' '129' it '203' to me, '284'," '136' '4' pale mate, gloomily.
Here, it '259' '460' be '136', '7' '829's '46' '14' '19' in '117' '169' '63' '390' occur'796' to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as developed in '4' mariner's '107'le, is, as '34' k'56', es'708'i'34'y '63' '31' '4' electri'709' beheld in heaven; hence it is '23' to be '137' marvelled at, '7' '375' '124's '134' be. Instances w'43' '4' '703'ning '129' '735'u'34'y struck '4' vessel, so as to smite d'249' '96' of '4' spars '6' rigging, '4' effect upon '4' '107'le '129' at '464' '91' s'773' '117' fatal; '34' '716' loadst'63' virtue '213' annihi'399'd, so '7' '4' '165' magnetic steel '28' of no '117' '364' '169' an '261' '362''s knitting '107'le. But in ei'4'r '390', '4' '107'le n'167' '158', of '716'elf, rec'118's '4' original virtue thus mar'796' or '387'; '6' if '4' binnacle com'962'es be affected, '4' '276' fate r'356'es '34' '4' '173's '7' '289' be in '4' ship; '140' '85' '4' l'969'r'344' '63' inserted '155' '4' kel'273'.
Deliberately st'6'ing '165' '4' binnacle, '6' '784'ing '4' t'868's'378'ed com'962'es, '4' '261' '128', '31' '4' sharp of '90' ex'606'ded h'6', '56' '111'k '4' precise bea'847' of '4' sun, '6' satisfied '7' '4' '107'les '85' '304' inverted, sh'44'ed '44' '90' '619's '17' '4' ship's '239' to be '397'd accordingly. The yards '85' '321' up; '6' '336' '117' '4' Pequod thrust '49' und'976'ed bows '155' '4' opposing '768'd, '17' '4' '340' '807' '63' '97' '146' '91' juggling '49'.
Mean'313', w'413'ver '85' '90' '249' '669' '147's, Starbuck '136' no'124', '33' '935'ly he issued '34' requi'421'e '619's; '313' Stubb '6' Fl'257'—'94' in '96' sm'34' degree '562'ed '98' to be sha'847' '90' '699'—'46'wise unmurmu'847'ly acquiesced. As '17' '4' '508', '463' '96' of '116' lowly rumbled, '238' fear of Ahab '28' '164'er '169' '238' fear of Fate. But as '167' '165', '4' pagan harpo'63'ers remained al'344' '94'lly unimpressed; or if impressed, it '28' '146' '31' a '979' magnetism s'576' '155' '238' congenial '374's '83' inflexible Ahab's.
For a space '4' '261' '128' '459'ed '4' deck in rolling r'167'ies. But chancing to slip '31' '90' ivory heel, he '282' '4' cru'50'd copper sight-tubes of '4' quad'868't he '97' '4' '183' '165' da'50'd to '4' deck.
"Thou '719', '896' heaven-gazer '6' sun's pi'202'! '89'ter'183' I wrecked '4'e, '6' to-'183' '4' com'962'es '72' fain '19' wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is lord '118' '4' level loadst'63' '332'. '197' Starbuck—a lance '327' a pole; a '739'-maul, '6' '4' sm'34'est of '4' sail-'106'r's '107'les. Quick!"
Accessory, '760', to '4' impulse dictating '4' '124' he '28' '56' '39' to do, '85' '979' prudential motives, '94'se object '240' '19' '91' to revive '4' spir'716' of '90' crew by a stroke of '90' subtile s'320', in a '301' so wondrous as '7' of '4' inverted com'962'es. Be'500's, '4' '261' '128' '35' k'212' '7' to steer by t'868's'378'ed '107'les, '463' clumsily pr'735'ic'473', '28' '23' a '124' to be '962'ed '118' by superstitious sailors, '327' '96' shudde'847's '6' '779' por'606'ts.
"Men," '136' he, steadily '391'ing upon '4' crew, as '4' mate h'6'ed '58' '4' '124's he '97' de'128'ded, "my '508', '4' th'447' '391'ed '261' Ahab's '107'les; '33' '44' of '14' '437' of steel Ahab '51' '106' '63' of '90' '249', '7' '76' '378' as '354' as '138'."
Aba'50'd glances of servile '683' '85' ex'397'd by '4' sailors, as '14' '28' '136'; '6' '31' fascinated '495' '69' a'154'ed w'413'ver magic '240' '858'. But Starbuck '720' '170'.
With a blow '83' '4' '739'-maul Ahab knocked '141' '4' steel '342' of '4' lance, '6' '98' h'6'ing to '4' mate '4' '192' iron rod remaining, '217'e '58' '330' it up'40', '327' '716' '678'ing '4' deck. Then, '31' '4' maul, '180' rep'545'edly smiting '4' upper '398' of '14' iron rod, he '226'd '4' blunted '107'le '398'wise on '4' '739' of it, '6' '759' '777'ly hamme'796' '7', s'167'al '464', '4' mate s'773' '956' '4' rod as '165'. Then '45' '209' '96' sm'34' st'868'ge motions '31' it—whe'4'r indispens'473' to '4' magnetizing of '4' steel, or merely in'606'ded to aug'508't '4' awe of '4' crew, is un'979'—he c'34'ed '17' '518'n th'504'; '6' '772' to '4' binnacle, slipped '44' '4' '149' r'167'sed '107'les t'43', '6' horizont'34'y susp'398'ed '4' sail-'107'le by '716' '845', '118' '63' of '4' com'962'-'324'ds. At '171', '4' steel '277' round '6' round, quive'847' '6' vibrating at ei'4'r '398'; '33' at '181' it '451'tled to '716' '226', '74' Ahab, '94' '97' '91' in'606'tly '763' '17' '14' result, '761'ped f'868'kly '78' '83' '4' binnacle, '6' '378'ing '90' stretched arm to'869'ds it, exclaimed,—"Look ye, '17' y'119'selves, if Ahab be '23' lord of '4' level loadst'63'! The sun is East, '6' '7' com'962' '746's it!"
One '180' an'173' '69' pee'796' in, '17' no'124' '33' '238' '249' '495' '87' persuade '375' igno'868'ce as '238's, '6' '63' '180' an'173' '69' slunk '170'.
In '90' fiery '495' of scorn '6' triumph, '1' '98' '282' Ahab in '34' '90' fatal p'852'.




CHAPTER 125. The Log '6' Line.

While '56' '4' fated Pequod '97' '91' so '192' afloat '14' voyage, '4' log '6' '518' '97' '33' '131' seldom '91' in '364'. O'768'g to a confident reliance upon '173' '410' of determining '4' vessel's '226', '96' merchant'508', '6' '128'y whale'508', especi'34'y '74' cruising, '94'lly neglect to heave '4' log; '463' at '4' '276' '75', '6' frequently '117' '17' '17'm's '997' '169' '138''124' '234', regularly '966' d'249' upon '4' customary s'399' '4' '239' stee'796' by '4' ship, as '35' as '4' presumed average rate of progression e'131' '612'. It '97' '91' thus '31' '4' Pequod. The wooden reel '6' angular log attached hung, '192' un'678'ed, '22' ben'545'h '4' railing of '4' '180' bul'869'ks. Rains '6' spray '97' damped it; sun '6' '768'd '97' '869'ped it; '34' '4' ele'508'ts '97' combined to rot a '124' '7' hung so idly. But heed'759' of '34' '14', '90' mood seized Ahab, as he '203' to glance upon '4' reel, '23' '128'y '520' '180' '4' magnet scene, '6' he '219'ed '60' '90' quad'868't '28' no '117', '6' rec'34'ed '90' f'868'tic oath '39' '4' level log '6' '518'. The ship '28' sailing plungingly; astern '4' '899'ows rolled in riots.
"For'869'd, t'43'! Heave '4' log!"
Two sea'508' '246'. The g'261'en-hued Ta'479'ian '6' '4' grizzly Manx'128'. "Take '4' reel, '63' of ye, '82' heave."
T'84' '277' to'869'ds '4' extreme stern, on '4' ship's lee '500', w'43' '4' deck, '31' '4' oblique energy of '4' '768'd, '28' '56' al'344' dipping '155' '4' creamy, '500''192'-rushing sea.
The Manx'128' '111'k '4' reel, '6' '956' it '530' up, by '4' projecting '627'-'398's of '4' spindle, round '265' '4' spool of '518' revolved, so s'111'd '31' '4' angular log '621'ing d'249''869'ds, '773' Ahab advanced to '58'.
Ahab s'111'd '165' '58', '6' '28' '703'ly un'768'ding '96' thirty or '17'ty '391's to '17'm a preliminary h'6'-coil to toss '118'board, '74' '4' '261' Manx'128', '94' '28' in'606'tly '784'ing '312' '58' '6' '4' '518', '721'e b'261' to '613'.
"Sir, I mis'395' it; '14' '518' '388' '458' g'63', '192' h'545' '6' wet '19' spoiled it."
"'T'76' '330', '261' gentle'128'. Long h'545' '6' wet, '19' '69' spoiled '4'e? Thou '562''st to '330'. Or, '354'r '760', '139' '330's '4'e; '23' thou it."
"I '330' '4' spool, '284'. But '22' as my captain '415'. With '182' grey h'769's of '462' 'tis '23' '736' '313' dis'186'ing, 'speci'34'y '31' a superior, '94''ll ne'er confess."
"What's '7'? T'43' '56''s a patched professor in Queen Nature's g'868'ite-'295'ed College; '33' '559'hinks '86' '111' subservient. W'43' wert thou born?"
"In '4' '105' rocky Isle of Man, '284'."
"Excellent! Thou'st '479' '4' '296' by '7'."
"I k'56' '23', '284', '33' I '28' born t'43'."
"In '4' Isle of Man, '84'? Well, '4' '173' '103', '30' '68'. Here's a '128' '83' Man; a '128' born in '336' indep'398'ent Man, '6' '56' un'128'ned of Man; '265' is sucked in—by '11'? Up '31' '4' reel! The '314', blind w'34' '33'ts '34' inqui'847' '342's at '181'. Up '31' it! So."
The log '28' heaved. The loose coils rapidly straigh'606'ed '44' in a '192' dragging '518' astern, '6' '98', instantly, '4' reel began to whirl. In '391', jerkingly raised '6' l'969''796' by '4' rolling '899'ows, '4' to'768'g resistance of '4' log ca'364'd '4' '261' reel'128' to stagger st'868'gely.
"H'261' '321'!"
Snap! '4' '118'strained '518' sagged d'249' in '63' '192' fes'111'n; '4' tugging log '28' g'63'.
"I crush '4' quad'868't, '4' th'447' '391's '4' '107'les, '6' '56' '4' '721' sea '348's '4' log-'518'. But Ahab '51' '508'd '34'. Haul in '43', Ta'479'ian; reel up, Manx'128'. And '73' ye, '123' '4' '324'penter '106' an'173' log, '6' '508'd thou '4' '518'. See to it."
"T'43' he '547' '56'; to '58' no'124''s '203'; '33' to me, '4' skewer '562's loosening '44' of '4' '845' of '4' '296'. Haul in, haul in, Ta'479'ian! These '518's '366' '251', '6' whirling '44': '67' in '785'n, '6' dragging slow. Ha, Pip? '67' to '148'; eh, Pip?"
"Pip? '94'm c'34' ye Pip? Pip jumped '83' '4' whale-boat. Pip's '376'ing. Let's '66' '56' if ye '298' fi'50'd '58' up '43', fi'50'r'128'. It drags '321'; I '214' '86' '956' on. Jerk '58', Ta'479'i! Jerk '58' '141'; we haul in no co'869'ds '43'. Ho! t'43''s '90' arm '22' '448'ing '604'. A hatchet! a hatchet! '537' it '141'—we haul in no co'869'ds '43'. Captain Ahab! '284', '284'! '43''s Pip, '244'ing to '42' on board '158'."
"Peace, thou '419' loon," cried '4' Manx'128', seizing '58' by '4' arm. "A'103' '83' '4' quarter-deck!"
"The '164'er idiot '167' s'690's '4' '759'er," mutte'796' Ahab, advancing. "H'6's '141' '83' '7' ho'518'ss! W'43' '99'est thou Pip '28', '311'?
"Astern t'43', '284', astern! Lo! lo!"
"And '94' art thou, '311'? I '66' '23' my reflection in '4' va'51't pupils of thy '495'. Oh God! '7' '128' '134' be a '124' '17' immortal souls to sieve '209'! Who art thou, '311'?"
"Bell-'311', '284'; ship's-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One hund'796' pounds of clay re'869'd '17' Pip; '401' '908' '530'—'388' co'869'dly—quickest '677' by '7'! Ding, dong, ding! Who's '333' Pip '4' co'869'd?"
"T'43' '51' be no '374's above '4' s'56'-'518'. Oh, ye frozen heavens! '73' d'249' '43'. Ye '64' be'42' '14' '672''759' '497', '6' '19' ab'6''63'd '58', ye cr'545'ive libertines.

"What's '14'? '43''s velvet shark-skin," in'606'tly gazing at Ahab's h'6', '6' '174'ing it. "Ah, '56', '97' '719' Pip '33' '577' so '207' a '124' as '14', '760' he '97' ne'er '91' '387'! T'90' '562's to me, '284', as a '128'-rope; so'559'hing '7' weak souls '289' '330' by.

CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.

Stee'847' '56' s'44'h-east'869'd by Ahab's levelled steel, '6' '49' progress solely deter'462'd by Ahab's level log '6' '518'; '4' Pequod held on '49' path to'869'ds '4' Equator. Making so '192' a '962'age '209' '375' unfrequented '604's, descrying no ships, '6' ere '192', '500''103's impelled by unvarying trade '768'ds, '118' waves mo'23'onously mild; '34' '182' '562'ed '4' st'868'ge '804' '124's preluding '96' riotous '6' desperate scene.
At '181', '74' '4' ship drew '958' to '4' '44'skirts, as it '85', of '4' Equatorial fishing-ground, '6' in '4' deep '967'ness '7' '547' '165' '4' dawn, '28' sailing by a cluster of rocky is'123's; '4' '430'—'98' '342'ed by Fl'257'—'28' '319'led by a cry so plaintively wild '6' un'987'ly—'46' '499'-articu'399'd wailings of '4' ghosts of '34' Herod's murde'796' Innocents—'7' '63' '6' '34', '69' '319'ed '83' '238' r'167'ies, '6' '17' '4' space of '96' mo'508'ts s'111'd, or sat, or leaned '34' t'868's'950'edly '919'ening, '46' '4' '324'ved Ro'128' slave, '313' '7' wild cry remained '31'in hea'847'. The '917'tian or civilized '348' of '4' crew '136' it '28' mermaids, '6' shudde'796'; '33' '4' pagan harpo'63'ers remained unapp'34'ed. Yet '4' grey Manx'128'—'4' '261'est mariner of '34'—decla'796' '7' '4' wild thrilling '602's '7' '85' '299', '85' '4' '915's of '212'ly dr'249'ed '508' in '4' sea.
Below in '90' hammock, Ahab '64' '23' '230' of '14' '773' grey dawn, '74' he '246' to '4' deck; it '28' '98' re'893'ed to '58' by Fl'257', '23' unaccompanied '31' hinted '967' '80'ings. He hollowly laughed, '6' thus '656'ed '4' '683'.
Those rocky isl'6's '4' ship '97' '962'ed '85' '4' re'563' of '164' '539's of seals, '6' '96' '507' seals '7' '97' '387' '238' dams, or '96' dams '7' '97' '387' '238' cubs, '259' '19' risen nigh '4' ship '6' '764' '624' '31' '49', crying '6' sobbing '31' '238' hu'128' '563' of wail. But '14' '146' '4' '117' affected '96' of '116', beca'364' '344' mariners c'49'ish a '131' superstitious '174'ing '39' seals, arising '23' '146' '83' '238' peculiar t'913' '74' in distress, '33' '516' '83' '4' hu'128' '73' of '238' round '342's '6' semi-in'81'igent '352's, '333' pee'847'ly uprising '83' '4' '604' '549''500'. In '4' sea, '447' '979' circumstances, seals '19' '117' '169' '336' '91' mis'645' '17' '508'.
But '4' bodings of '4' crew '85' destined to receive a '344' plausible confirmation in '4' fate of '63' of '238' '539' '7' '339'. At sun-rise '14' '128' '277' '83' '90' hammock to '90' mast-'342' at '4' '17'e; '6' whe'4'r it '28' '7' he '28' '23' '332' '499' '830'd '83' '90' '503' ('17' sailors so'559'imes go aloft in a t'868''421'ion '892'), whe'4'r it '28' thus '31' '4' '128', t'43' is '56' no '361'; '33', be '7' as it '289', he '97' '23' '91' '192' at '90' perch, '74' a cry '28' '299'—a cry '6' a rushing—'6' '262' up, '69' '282' a f'34'ing phantom in '4' '769'; '6' '262' d'249', a '105' tossed heap of '691' bubbles in '4' blue of '4' sea.
The '139'-buoy—a '192' sl'398'er c'257'—'28' '705'ped '83' '4' stern, w'43' it '194' hung obe'474'nt to a cunning sp'847'; '33' no h'6' rose to seize it, '6' '4' sun '305' '192' '942' upon '14' c'257' it '97' sh'366'ken, so '7' it slowly filled, '6' '7' parched wood '516' filled at '716' e'131' pore; '6' '4' studded iron-bound c'257' '858'ed '4' sailor to '4' bottom, as if to yield '58' '90' pillow, '463' in sooth '33' a '321' '63'.
And thus '4' '171' '128' of '4' Pequod '7' mounted '4' mast to '73' '44' '17' '4' W'479'e Whale, on '4' W'479'e Whale's '249' peculiar ground; '7' '128' '28' sw'34''969'd up in '4' deep. But '360', '760', '147' of '7' at '4' '75'. Indeed, in '96' '563', '69' '85' '23' grieved at '14' '140't, at '402' as a por'606't; '17' '69' regarded it, '23' as a '17'es'97'o'768'g of '779' in '4' '670', '33' as '4' fulfil'508't of an '779' '287' presaged. T'84' decla'796' '7' '56' '69' k'212' '4' '385' of '200' wild shrieks '69' '97' '299' '4' '168' '165'. But '158' '4' '261' Manx'128' '136' nay.
The '387' '139'-buoy '28' '56' to be re'226'd; Starbuck '28' directed to '66' to it; '33' as no c'257' of sufficient '703'ness '87' be '295', '6' as in '4' f'167'ish eagerness of '11' '562'ed '4' approaching crisis of '4' voyage, '34' '524' '85' impatient of '138' toil '33' '11' '28' directly connected '31' '716' final '398', w'413'ver '7' '240' '831' to be; t'43''17'e, '69' '85' '45' to '224' '4' ship's stern unprovided '31' a buoy, '74' by '979' st'868'ge '659's '6' inu'398'oes Queequeg hinted a hint c'336'rning '90' c'141'in.
"A '139'-buoy of a c'141'in!" cried Starbuck, '319'ing.
"Ra'4'r queer, '7', I '134' '99'," '136' Stubb.
"It '76' '106' a '68' '243' '63'," '136' Fl'257', "'4' '324'penter '43' '51' ar'868'ge it easily."
"B'847' it up; t'43''s no'124' '234' '17' it," '136' Starbuck, '180' a melancholy pa'364'. "Rig it, '324'penter; do '23' '73' at me so—'4' c'141'in, I '80'. Dost thou '230' me? Rig it."
"And sh'34' I nail d'249' '4' lid, '284'?" '772' '90' h'6' as '31' a hammer.
"Aye."
"And sh'34' I caulk '4' seams, '284'?" '772' '90' h'6' as '31' a caulking-iron.
"Aye."
"And sh'34' I '98' '490' '118' '4' '276' '31' pitch, '284'?" '772' '90' h'6' as '31' a pitch-pot.
"A'103'! '11' possesses '4'e to '14'? Make a '139'-buoy of '4' c'141'in, '6' no '117'.—'197' Stubb, '197' Fl'257', '67' '17''869'd '31' me."
"He '547' '141' in a huff. The '251' he '51' '398'ure; at '4' '348's he baulks. Now I '21' '46' '14'.

Are '34' my '684's to go '17' no'124' '31' '7' c'141'in? And '56' '16' '619'ed to '106' a '139'-buoy of it. It's '46' '391'ing an '261' coat; '45' to b'847' '4' flesh on '4' '173' '500' '56'.

It's '4' '261' '263''s tricks to be '631' cobbling '292's. Lord! '11' an affection '34' '261' '607' '19' '17' tinkers.

CHAPTER 127. The Deck.

The c'141'in laid upon '149' '518'-tubs, '592'ween '4' v'972'-bench '6' '4' '422' hatch'103'; '4' Carpenter caulking '716' seams; '4' st'847' of twisted oakum slowly un'768'ding '83' a large roll of it '226'd in '4' bosom of '90' frock.—Ahab '67's slowly '83' '4' cabin-gang'103', '6' '230's Pip '858'ing '58'.
"Back, lad; I '76' be '31' ye '158' '986'ly. He '547'! Not '14' h'6' comp'596's '31' my humor '117' geni'34'y '169' '7' '311'.—Middle aisle of a church! What's '43'?"
"Life-buoy, '284'. '197' Starbuck's '619's. Oh, '73', '284'! Bew'36' '4' hatch'103'!"
"Thank ye, '128'. Thy c'141'in '596's h'6'y to '4' vault."
"Sir? The hatch'103'? oh! So it '185', '284', so it '185'."
"Art '23' thou '4' leg-'106'r? Look, '64' '23' '14' stump '67' '83' thy shop?"
"I '172' it '64', '284'; '185' '4' ferrule st'6', '284'?"
"Well '243'. But art thou '23' '516' '4' '447''101'r?"
"Aye, '284'; I patched up '14' '124' '43' as a c'141'in '17' Queequeg; '33' '69''ve '451' me '56' to '391'ing it '155' so'559'hing '234'."
"Then '81' me; art thou '23' an ar'868't, '34'-grasping, intermeddling, monopolising, hea'98'ish '261' scamp, to be '63' '183' '380' legs, '6' '4' '290' '183' c'141'ins to clap '116' in, '6' '332' '158' '139'-buoys '44' of '200' '276' c'141'ins? Thou art as unprincipled as '4' '152's, '6' as '137' of a jack-of-'34'-trades."
"But I do '23' '80' '138''124', '284'. I do as I do."
"The '152's '158'. Hark ye, dost thou '23' '167' sing '406' '39' a c'141'in? The Titans, '69' '99', hummed snatches '74' chipping '44' '4' craters '17' vol'51'oes; '6' '4' grave-digger in '4' '412' sings, spade in h'6'. Dost thou n'167'?"
"Sing, '284'? Do I sing? Oh, '16' in'465' '243', '284', '17' '7'; '33' '4' '385' '65' '4' grave-digger '721'e '886' '259' '19' '91' beca'364' t'43' '28' '697' in '90' spade, '284'. But '4' caulking m'34'et is '597' of it. Hark to it."
"Aye, '6' '55' beca'364' '4' lid t'43''s a '602'ing-board; '6' '11' in '34' '124's '408' '4' '602'ing-board is '14'—t'43''s naught ben'545'h. And '332', a c'141'in '31' a '618' in it '847's '281' '137' '4' '276', Carpenter. Hast thou '167' '148'ed '324'ry a bier, '6' '299' '4' c'141'in knock '485' '4' churchyard gate, '45' in?

"Faith? What's '7'?"
"Why, faith, '284', '30' '146' a '563' of exclamation-'46'—'55' '34', '284'."
"Um, um; go on."
"I '28' '39' to '99', '284', '7'—"
"Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy '249' shroud '44' of thy'968'? Look at thy bosom! Despatch! '6' '42' '182' traps '44' of sight."
"He '547' aft. That '28' sudden, '56'; '33' squ'34's '67' sudden in '576' latitudes. '114' '299' '7' '4' Isle of Albemarle, '63' of '4' G'34'ip'414's, is '537' by '4' Equator '40' in '4' '845'.

T'90' wooden m'34'et is '4' cork, '6' '16' '4' professor of '886'al gl'652'es—tap, tap!"
(Ahab to '58''968'.)
"T'43''s a sight! T'43''s a '602'! The grey-'342'ed woodpecker tapping '4' hollow tree! Blind '6' dumb '240' '35' be envied '56'. See! '7' '124' '426's on '149' '518'-tubs, '597' of tow-'518's. A '344' malicious wag, '7' '947'ow. Rat-tat! So '128''s '347's tick! Oh! '60' immaterial '36' '34' materials! What '124's '272' '36' t'43', '33' imponder'473' '147's?

Can it be '7' in '96' spiritual '587' '4' c'141'in is, '180' '34', '33' an immortality-preserver! '82' '54' of '7'. But no. So '458' g'63' am I in '4' '967' '500' of '987', '7' '716' '173' '500', '4' '4'oretic b'40' '63', '562's '33' un'979' twi'703' to me. Will ye n'167' '19' d'63', Carpenter, '31' '7' accursed '602'?

"Hast '333' '4' W'479'e Whale?"
"Aye, '89'ter'183'. Have ye '333' a whale-boat adrift?"
Throttling '90' joy, Ahab negatively '491'ed '14' un'741'ed '455'; '6' '72' '98' '19' fain boarded '4' st'868'ger, '74' '4' st'868'ger captain '58''968', '305' '188'ped '90' vessel's '103', '28' '333' desc'398'ing '49' '500'. A '360' keen '732's, '6' '90' boat-hook '358' clinched '4' Pequod's main-chains, '6' he sp'868'g to '4' deck. Immediately he '28' recognised by Ahab '17' a Nantucketer he k'212'. But no '17'mal salutation '28' ex'397'd.
"W'43' '28' he?—'23' '466'!—'23' '466'!" cried Ahab, '452'ly advancing. "How '28' it?"
It '562'ed '7' '96''11' '399' on '4' '180'noon of '4' '183' previous, '313' '291' of '4' st'868'ger's boats '85' engaged '31' a shoal of whales, '265' '97' led '116' '96' '492' or '401' miles '83' '4' ship; '6' '313' '69' '85' '332' in swift c'129'e to '768'd'869'd, '4' '691' hump '6' '342' of Moby Dick '97' suddenly loomed up '44' of '4' '604', '23' '131' '458' to lee'869'd; w'43'upon, '4' '492'th rigged boat—a reserved '63'—'97' '91' instantly l'969''796' in c'129'e. After a keen sail '165' '4' '768'd, '14' '492'th boat—'4' swif'704' keeled of '34'—'562'ed to '19' succeeded in fas'606'ing—at '402', as '35' as '4' '128' at '4' mast-'342' '87' '81' '138''124' '39' it. In '4' distance he '282' '4' dimini'50'd dotted boat; '6' '98' a swift gleam of bubbling '691' '604'; '6' '180' '7' no'124' '117'; '74'ce it '28' concluded '7' '4' stricken whale '259' '19' in'780' '366' '170' '31' '90' pursuers, as of'606' '308's. T'43' '28' '96' apprehension, '33' no po'421'ive alarm, as '332'. The rec'34' '659'als '85' '226'd in '4' rigging; '967'ness '246' on; '6' '17'ced to '512' up '49' '291' '458' to '768'd'869'd boats—ere '45' in quest of '4' '492'th '63' in '4' precisely oppo'421'e direction—'4' ship '97' '23' '146' '91' neces'421'ated to '224' '7' boat to '716' fate '773' '958' mid'168', '33', '17' '4' '75', to increase '49' distance '83' it. But '4' '426' of '49' crew '213' at '181' '564' aboard, '50' crowded '34' sail—stunsail on stunsail—'180' '4' '376'ing boat; '207'ling a '522' in '49' '244'-pots '17' a beacon; '6' e'131' '173' '128' aloft on '4' '73'-'44'. But '463' '74' '50' '97' thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain '4' presumed '226' of '4' ab'708' '913' '74' '181' '333'; '463' '50' '98' pa'364'd to l'969'r '49' sp'36' boats to '732' '34' '187' '49'; '6' '23' '156'ing '138''124', '97' '158' da'50'd on; '158' pa'364'd, '6' l'969''796' '49' boats; '6' '463' '50' '97' thus continued '143' '773' '183''703'; '332' '23' '4' '402' glimpse of '4' '376'ing keel '97' '91' '333'.
The '480' '163', '4' st'868'ger Captain immediately '277' on to reveal '90' object in boarding '4' Pequod. He de'284'ed '7' ship to unite '31' '90' '249' in '4' search; by sailing '118' '4' sea '96' '492' or '401' miles a'348', on par'34'el '518's, '6' so sweeping a double horizon, as it '85'.
"I '76' wager so'559'hing '56'," w'90'pe'796' Stubb to Fl'257', "'7' '96' '63' in '7' '376'ing boat wore '141' '7' Captain's '258' coat; '289'hap, '90' '430'—'86' so cursed anxious to '42' it '78'. Who '167' '299' of '149' pious whale-ships cruising '180' '63' '376'ing whale-boat in '4' h'879' of '4' whaling sea'273'? See, Fl'257', '146' '66' '60' pale he '388'—pale in '4' '131' '33'tons of '90' '495'—'73'—it '237' '4' coat—it '259' '19' '91' '4'—"
"My '311', my '249' '311' is among '116'. For God's '997'—I beg, I conjure"—'43' exclaimed '4' st'868'ger Captain to Ahab, '94' thus '458' '97' '33' icily received '90' petition. "For '879'-'6'-'17'ty '520' '123' me charter y'119' ship—I '76' '431'ly '490' '17' it, '6' roundly '490' '17' it—if t'43' be no '173' '103'—'17' '879'-'6'-'17'ty '520' '146'—'146' '7'—'1' '259', oh, '1' '259', '6' '1' sh'34' do '14' '124'."
"His '273'!" cried Stubb, "oh, '30' '90' '273' '86' '387'! I '101' '78' '4' coat '6' '430'—'11' '415' Ahab? We '259' '550' '7' '311'."
"He's dr'249'ed '31' '4' '426' on '514', '181' '168'," '136' '4' '261' Manx sailor st'6'ing '528' '116'; "I '299'; '34' of ye '299' '238' spir'716'."
Now, as it '940'ly '391'ed '44', '11' '721'e '14' incident of '4' Rachel's '4' '117' melancholy, '28' '4' circumstance, '7' '23' '146' '28' '63' of '4' Captain's '273's among '4' '539' of '4' '376'ing boat's crew; '33' among '4' '539' of '4' '173' boat's crews, at '4' '276' '75', '33' on '4' '173' h'6', separated '83' '4' ship du'847' '4' '967' vicis'421'udes of '4' c'129'e, t'43' '97' '91' s'773' an'173' '273'; as '7' '17' a '75', '4' wretched '233' '28' plunged to '4' bottom of '4' cruellest perplexity; '265' '28' '146' solved '17' '58' by '90' chief mate's instinctively adopting '4' ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in '375' emergencies, '7' is, '74' '226'd '592'ween jeopardized '33' divided boats, '194' to '512' up '4' majority '171'. But '4' captain, '17' '96' un'677' constitutional '385', '97' refrained '83' '508'tioning '34' '14', '6' '23' '773' '17'ced to it by Ahab's iciness '64' he '34'ude to '90' '63' '332' '376'ing '311'; a '105' lad, '33' twelve '266' '261', '94'se '233' '31' '4' earnest '33' unmis'631' '321'ihood of a Nantucketer's paternal '112', '97' thus '865' sought to initiate '58' in '4' perils '6' '683's of a vocation al'344' immemori'34'y '4' destiny of '34' '90' race. Nor '185' it unfrequently occur, '7' Nantucket captains '76' '642' a '273' of '375' '606'der age '170' '83' '116', '17' a protr'735'ed '291' or '492' '266'' voyage in '96' '173' ship '169' '238' '249'; so '7' '238' '171' k'56'ledge of a whale'128''s '324'eer sh'34' be unenervated by '138' '365' dis'412' of a '233''s natural '33' un'75'ly '348'iality, or undue apprehensiveness '6' c'336'rn.
Mean'75', '56' '4' st'868'ger '28' s'773' be'66'ching '90' '719' boon of Ahab; '6' Ahab s'773' s'111'd '46' an anvil, receiving e'131' shock, '33' '327' '4' '402' quive'847' of '90' '249'.
"I '76' '23' go," '136' '4' st'868'ger, "'773' '1' '99' aye to me. Do to me as '1' '72' '19' me do to '1' in '4' '46' '390'. For '1' '111' '19' a '311', Captain Ahab—'463' '33' a '497', '6' nestling '564'ly at '179' '56'—a '497' of y'119' '261' age '111'—Yes, '89', '1' relent; I '66' it—'366', '366', '508', '56', '6' st'6' by to squ'36' in '4' yards."
"Avast," cried Ahab—"'678' '23' a rope-yarn"; '98' in a '915' '7' pro'192'ingly moulded e'131' '429'—"Captain Gardiner, I '76' '23' do it. '938'n '56' I '521' '75'. Good-'370', '68'-'370'.

Hurriedly '391'ing, '31' averted '352', he desc'398'ed '155' '90' cabin, '568' '4' st'868'ge captain t'868's'950'ed at '14' unconditional '6' utter rejection of '90' so earnest suit. But '319'ing '83' '90' enchant'508't, Gardiner silently hurried to '4' '500'; '117' '947' '169' '761'ped '155' '90' boat, '6' re'391'ed to '90' ship.
Soon '4' '149' ships diverged '238' '830's; '6' '192' as '4' st'868'ge vessel '28' in view, '50' '28' '333' to yaw '479''49' '6' t'479''49' at e'131' '967' spot, '60''167' sm'34', on '4' sea.

But by '49' s'773' halting '239' '6' '768'ding, woeful '103', '1' plainly '282' '7' '14' ship '7' so wept '31' spray, s'773' remained '327' com'17't. She '28' Rachel, weeping '17' '49' '566', beca'364' '69' '85' '23'.




CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.

(Ahab '772' to go on deck; Pip '756'es '58' by '4' h'6' to '858'.)
"Lad, lad, I '81' '4'e thou '259' '23' '858' Ahab '56'. The '612' is '260' '74' Ahab '72' '23' s'324'e '4'e '83' '58', '332' '72' '23' '19' '4'e by '58'.

Do thou abide below '43', w'43' '69' sh'34' serve '4'e, as if thou wert '4' captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt '421' '43' in my '249' screwed ch'769'; an'173' screw to it, thou '259' be."
"No, no, no! ye '19' '23' a '251' '618', '284'; do ye '33' '364' '719' me '17' y'119' '63' '387' leg; '146' t'504' upon me, '284'; I '257' no '117', so I remain a '348' of ye."
"Oh! spite of '827' villains, '14' '408' me a bi'61' in '4' fade'759' fidelity of '128'!—'6' a '751'! '6' '419'!—'33' '559'hinks '46'-cures-'46' app'596's to '58' '111'; he grows so sane '158'."
"T'84' '81' me, '284', '7' Stubb '64' '336' desert '719' '105' Pip, '94'se dr'249'ed b'913' '56' s'60' '691', '17' '34' '4' '751'ness of '90' '565' skin. But I '76' n'167' desert ye, '284', as Stubb '64' '58'. Sir, I '259' go '31' ye."
"If thou '613'est thus to me '137' '117', Ahab's purpose keels up in '58'. I '81' '4'e no; it '51''23' be."
"Oh '68' master, master, master!
"Weep so, '6' I '76' '776' '4'e! '19' a '324'e, '17' Ahab '111' is '721'. Lis'606', '6' thou wilt of'606' '230' my ivory foot upon '4' deck, '6' s'773' k'56' '7' I am t'43'. And '56' I quit '4'e.

(Ahab '547'; Pip '761's '63' '761' '17''869'd.)
"Here he '14' instant s'111'd; I st'6' in '90' '769',—'33' '16' al'63'. Now '85' '140' '719' Pip '43' I '87' '398'ure it, '33' '86' '376'ing. Pip! Pip! Ding, dong, ding! Who's '333' Pip?

CHAPTER 130. The Hat.

And '56' '7' at '4' proper '75' '6' '226', '180' so '192' '6' wide a preliminary cruise, Ahab,—'34' '173' whaling '604's swept—'562'ed to '19' c'129'ed '90' foe '155' an ocean-f'261', to slay '58' '4' '117' securely t'43'; '56', '7' he '295' '58''968' '321' by '4' '131' latitude '6' '192'itude w'43' '90' tor'508'ting wound '97' '91' inflicted; '56' '7' a vessel '97' '91' spoken '265' on '4' '131' '183' preceding '97' '735'u'34'y en'893'e'796' Moby Dick;—'6' '56' '7' '34' '90' successive '381'ings '31' various ships contrastingly concur'796' to s'60' '4' demoniac indifference '31' '265' '4' '691' whale tore '90' hunters, whe'4'r sinning or sinned '485'; '56' it '28' '7' t'43' lurked a so'559'hing in '4' '261' '128''s '495', '265' it '28' '321'ly suffer'473' '17' feeble souls to '66'. As '4' un'451'ting polar star, '265' '209' '4' '349''192', arctic, '578' '611'' '168' sustains '716' piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab's purpose '56' '950'edly gleamed d'249' upon '4' constant mid'168' of '4' gloomy crew. It do'462'e'796' above '116' so, '7' '34' '238' bodings, doubts, mis'631's, fears, '85' fain to hide ben'545'h '238' souls, '6' '23' spr'44' '17'th a single spear or leaf.
In '14' '17'es'97'o'768'g interval '111', '34' humor, '17'ced or natural, vani'50'd. Stubb no '117' strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no '117' strove to '396' '63'. A'46', joy '6' sorrow, '274' '6' fear, '562'ed ground to '178'st dust, '6' powde'796', '17' '4' '75', in '4' clamped mortar of Ahab's iron soul. Like machines, '69' dumbly '367'd '39' '4' deck, '167' conscious '7' '4' '261' '128''s despot '784' '28' on '116'.
But '64' '1' deeply s'51' '58' in '90' '117' '669' confidential '520'; '74' he '147' no glance '33' '63' '28' on '58'; '98' '1' '72' '19' '333' '7' '140' as Ahab's '495' so awed '4' crew's, '4' inscrut'473' Par'66''s glance awed '90'; or '96''60', at '402', in '96' wild '103', at '464' affected it.

Nor, at '138' '75', by '168' or '183' '87' '4' mariners '56' '761' upon '4' deck, un'759' Ahab '28' '165' '116'; ei'4'r st'6'ing in '90' pivot-hole, or '304' pacing '4' '519'ks '592'ween '149' undeviating lim'716',—'4' main-mast '6' '4' mizen; or '234' '69' '282' '58' st'6'ing in '4' cabin-s'537'tle,—'90' '565' foot advanced upon '4' deck, as if to '761'; '90' hat slouched heavily '118' '90' '495'; so '7' '60''167' motion'759' he s'111'd, '60''167' '4' '433' '6' '168's '85' added on, '7' he '97' '23' swung in '90' hammock; '332' hidden ben'545'h '7' slouching hat, '69' '87' n'167' '81' uner'847'ly whe'4'r, '17' '34' '14', '90' '495' '85' re'34'y '452'd at '464'; or whe'4'r he '28' s'773' in'606'tly s'51'ning '116'; no '301', '463' he s'111'd so in '4' s'537'tle '17' a '251' '612' on '4' stretch, '6' '4' unheeded '168'-damp gat'43'd in beads of dew upon '7' st'63'-'324'ved coat '6' hat. The '945' '7' '4' '168' '97' wet, '4' '290' '183''s sunshine dried upon '58'; '6' so, '183' '180' '183', '6' '168' '180' '168'; he '277' no '117' ben'545'h '4' '519'ks; w'413'ver he '53'ed '83' '4' cabin '7' '124' he '708' '17'.
He ate in '4' '276' '422' '769'; '7' is, '90' '149' '146' meals,—'448''692' '6' '484': supper he n'167' '678'ed; nor reaped '90' beard; '265' '967'ly grew '34' gnarled, as un'987'ed roots of trees bl'249' '118', '265' s'773' grow idly on at naked base, '463' peri'50'd in '4' upper verdure. But '463' '90' '251' '139' '28' '56' be'67' '63' '430' on deck; '6' '463' '4' Par'66''s mystic '430' '28' '327' inter'376'ion as '90' '249'; '332' '182' '149' n'167' '562'ed to '613'—'63' '128' to '4' '173'—un'759' at '192' intervals '96' '962'ing unmo'508'tous '301' '721'e it necessary. Though '375' a po'606't spell '562'ed '669'ly to join '4' twain; '422'ly, '6' to '4' awe-struck crew, '69' '562'ed pole-'46' as'447'. If by '183' '69' '365'd to '613' '63' '429'; by '168', dumb '508' '85' '312', so '458' as '936' '4' s'703'est verbal inter'397'. At '464', '17' '192'est '520', '327' a single hail, '69' s'111'd '458' '348'ed in '4' star'703'; Ahab in '90' s'537'tle, '4' Par'66' by '4' mainmast; '33' s'773' '950'edly gazing upon '356' '173'; as if in '4' Par'66' Ahab '282' '90' '17'e'687'n s'97'ow, in Ahab '4' Par'66' '90' ab'6''63'd substance.
And '332', '96''60', '64' Ahab—in '90' '249' proper '968', as daily, '612'ly, '6' e'131' instant, com'128'dingly revealed to '90' subordinates,—Ahab '562'ed an indep'398'ent lord; '4' Par'66' '33' '90' slave. S'773' '158' '312' '562'ed yoked to'42''49', '6' an un'333' ty'868't driving '116'; '4' lean s'97'e siding '4' solid rib. For be '14' Par'66' '11' he '289', '34' rib '6' keel '28' solid Ahab.
At '4' '171' fain'704' glimme'847' of '4' dawn, '90' iron '915' '28' '299' '83' aft,—"Man '4' mast-'342's!"—'6' '34' '209' '4' '183', '773' '180' sun'451' '6' '180' twi'703', '4' '276' '915' e'131' '612', at '4' striking of '4' helms'128''s bell, '28' '299'—"What d'ye '66'?—sharp! sharp!"
But '74' '291' or '492' '433' '97' slided by, '180' '381'ing '4' '566'-'66'king Rachel; '6' no sp'44' '97' '332' '91' '333'; '4' mono'128'iac '261' '128' '562'ed dis'395'ful of '90' crew's fidelity; at '402', of '958'ly '34' '722' '4' Pagan harpo'63'ers; he '562'ed to doubt, '140', whe'4'r Stubb '6' Fl'257' '240' '23' '76'ingly '118''73' '4' sight he sought. But if '182' suspicions '85' re'34'y '90', he sagaciously refrained '83' verb'34'y expressing '116', '60''167' '90' '735'ions '240' '562' to hint '116'.
"I '76' '19' '4' '171' sight of '4' whale '302',"—he '136'. "Aye! Ahab '259' '19' '4' doubloon! '6' '31' '90' '249' '524' he rigged a nest of b'257'eted bow'518's; '6' '642'ing a h'6' aloft, '31' a single '50'aved block, to secure to '4' main-mast '342', he received '4' '149' '398's of '4' d'249''869'd-reeved rope; '6' attaching '63' to '90' b'257'et prepa'796' a pin '17' '4' '173' '398', in '619' to fas'606' it at '4' rail. T'90' d'63', '31' '7' '398' '332' in '90' h'6' '6' st'6'ing be'500' '4' pin, he '720' round upon '90' crew, sweeping '83' '63' to '4' '173'; pa'970' '90' glance '192' upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; '33' shunning Fed'34'ah; '6' '98' '451'tling '90' firm re'666' '784' upon '4' chief mate, '136',—"Take '4' rope, '284'—I '145' it '155' thy '524', Starbuck." Then ar'868'ging '90' '369' in '4' b'257'et, he '417' '4' '429' '17' '116' to hoist '58' to '90' perch, Starbuck '213' '4' '63' '94' secu'796' '4' rope at '181'; '6' '180''869'ds s'111'd '958' it. And thus, '31' '63' h'6' clinging round '4' royal mast, Ahab gazed ab'937' upon '4' sea '17' miles '6' miles,—'531', astern, '14' '500', '6' '7',—'31'in '4' wide exp'6'ed circle com'128'ded at so '164' a h'879'.
When in '406' '31' '90' '524' at '96' lofty al'344' iso'399'd '226' in '4' rigging, '265' '365's to af'17'd no foot'330', '4' sailor at sea is hoisted up to '7' spot, '6' sustained t'43' by '4' rope; '447' '182' circumstances, '716' fas'606'ed '398' on deck is '194' '145'n in strict charge to '96' '63' '128' '94' '129' '4' '591' '430' of it. Beca'364' in '375' a wilderness of '573' rigging, '94'se various '465' relations aloft '51''23' '194' be inf'34'ibly discerned by '11' is '333' of '116' at '4' deck; '6' '74' '4' deck-'398's of '182' ropes '36' '213' e'131' '360' '294's cast d'249' '83' '4' fas'606'ings, it '72' be '33' a natural fatality, if, unprovided '31' a constant '430''128', '4' hoisted sailor '134' by '96' '324'e'759'ness of '4' crew be cast adrift '6' f'34' '34' swooping to '4' sea. So Ahab's proceedings in '14' '301' '85' '23' unusual; '4' '146' st'868'ge '124' '39' '116' '562'ed to be, '7' Starbuck, al'344' '4' '63' '146' '128' '94' '97' '167' ventu'796' to oppose '58' '31' '138''124' in '4' s'703'est degree approaching to '911'—'63' of '200' '111', '94'se faithfulness on '4' '73'-'44' he '97' '562'ed to doubt '96''11';—it '28' st'868'ge, '7' '14' '28' '4' '131' '128' he '134' select '17' '90' '430''128'; '523'ly '631' '90' '251' '139' '155' '375' an '173'wise dis'395'ed '369''s '524'.
Now, '4' '171' '75' Ahab '28' perched aloft; ere he '97' '91' t'43' '606' '294's; '63' of '200' '796'-'899'ed savage sea-hawks '265' so of'606' fly incommodiously '452' round '4' '128'ned mast-'342's of whale'508' in '182' latitudes; '63' of '182' birds '246' wheeling '6' screaming round '90' '342' in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thous'6' '908' '688' up '155' '4' '769'; '98' spiralized d'249''869'ds, '6' '277' eddying '158' round '90' '342'.
But '31' '90' gaze '950'ed upon '4' dim '6' distant horizon, Ahab '562'ed '23' to mark '14' wild bird; nor, indeed, '72' '138' '63' '234' '19' marked it '137', it '213' no uncommon circumstance; '146' '56' al'344' '4' '402' heedful '784' '562'ed to '66' '96' '563' of cunning '80'ing in al'344' e'131' sight.
"Y'119' hat, y'119' hat, '284'!" suddenly cried '4' Sicilian sea'128', '94' '213' posted at '4' mizen-mast-'342', s'111'd directly '528' Ahab, '463' '96''11' l'969'r '169' '90' level, '6' '31' a deep gulf of '769' dividing '116'.
But '287' '4' s'473' '768'g '28' '165' '4' '261' '128''s '495'; '4' '192' hooked '899' at '90' '342': '31' a scream, '4' '751' hawk darted '170' '31' '90' prize.
An eagle flew thr'972' round Tarquin's '342', re'772' '90' cap to re'226' it, '6' t'43'upon Tanaquil, '90' '362', decla'796' '7' Tarquin '72' be king of Rome. But '146' by '4' replacing of '4' cap '28' '7' o'508' ac'893'ed '68'. Ahab's hat '28' n'167' '426'o'796'; '4' wild hawk flew on '6' on '31' it; '458' in advance of '4' prow: '6' at '181' disappea'796'; '313' '83' '4' '378' of '7' disappea'868'ce, a '294' '751' spot '28' dimly discerned, f'34'ing '83' '7' vast h'879' '155' '4' sea.




CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The De'703'.

The in'606'se Pequod sailed on; '4' rolling waves '6' '433' '277' by; '4' '139'-buoy-c'141'in s'773' '703'ly swung; '6' an'173' ship, '344' miserably mis'275'd '4' De'703', '28' descried. As '50' drew nigh, '34' '495' '85' '950'ed upon '49' b'937' beams, c'34'ed '50'ars, '265', in '96' whaling-ships, cross '4' quarter-deck at '4' h'879' of '879' or nine '908'; serving to '324'ry '4' sp'36', unrigged, or dis'473'd boats.
Upon '4' st'868'ger's '50'ars '85' beheld '4' shatte'796', '691' ribs, '6' '96' '360' splinte'796' '519'ks, of '11' '97' '336' '91' a whale-boat; '33' '1' '56' '282' '209' '14' wreck, as plainly as '1' '66' '209' '4' peeled, '499'-unhinged, '6' bl'356'ing ske'123'on of a horse.
"Hast '333' '4' W'479'e Whale?"
"Look!" rep'596'd '4' hollow-cheeked captain '83' '90' taffrail; '6' '31' '90' trumpet he '378'ed to '4' wreck.
"Hast '466' '58'?"
"The harpoon is '23' '332' '17'ged '7' '167' '76' do '7'," '491'ed '4' '173', sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on '4' deck, '94'se gat'43'd '500's '96' noise'759' sailors '85' '748' in se'768'g to'42''49'.
"Not '17'ged!" '6' snatching Perth's levelled iron '83' '4' crotch, Ahab held it '44', exclaiming—"Look ye, Nantucketer; '43' in '14' h'6' I '330' '90' '548'! Tempe'796' in '593', '6' tempe'796' by '703'ning '36' '182' '960'bs; '6' I '746' to temper '116' '798'ly in '7' '576' '226' '528' '4' fin, w'43' '4' W'479'e Whale '344' '174's '90' accursed '139'!"
"Then God '184' '4'e, '261' '128'—'66''st thou '7'"—'378'ing to '4' hammock—"I bury '33' '63' of '401' st'44' '508', '94' '85' a'349' '146' '89'ter'183'; '33' '85' '314' ere '168'. Only '7' '63' I bury; '4' '426' '85' buried '165' '69' '474'd; '1' sail upon '238' tomb." Then '391'ing to '90' crew—"Are ye '325' t'43'? '226' '4' '519'k '98' on '4' rail, '6' lift '4' '618'; so, '98'—Oh! God"—advancing to'869'ds '4' hammock '31' uplifted '524'—"'289' '4' resurrection '6' '4' '139'—"
"Brace '17''869'd! Up helm!" cried Ahab '46' '703'ning to '90' '508'.
But '4' suddenly '319'ed Pequod '28' '23' quick '243' to escape '4' '602' of '4' splash '7' '4' corpse '358' '721'e as it struck '4' sea; '23' so quick, indeed, '33' '7' '96' of '4' f'666' bubbles '240' '19' sprinkled '49' hull '31' '238' ghostly baptism.
As Ahab '56' glided '83' '4' dejected De'703', '4' st'868'ge '139'-buoy '621'ing at '4' Pequod's stern '246' '155' conspicuous re'596'f.
"Ha! yonder! '73' yonder, '508'!" cried a '17'eboding '915' in '49' '830'. "In vain, oh, ye st'868'gers, ye fly '119' sad burial; ye '33' '391' us y'119' taffrail to s'60' us y'119' c'141'in!"




CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.

It '28' a '574' steel-blue '183'. The firma'508'ts of '769' '6' sea '85' '321'ly separ'473' in '7' '34'-pervading azure; '146', '4' pensive '769' '28' t'868'sp'36'ntly pure '6' soft, '31' a '263''s '73', '6' '4' robust '6' '128'-'46' sea heaved '31' '192', '777', linge'847' s'35's, as '469''273''s chest in '90' '503'.
Hi'4'r, '6' t'479''49', on '530', glided '4' s'56'-'691' '768'gs of sm'34', unspeckled birds; '182' '85' '4' gentle '147's of '4' feminine '769'; '33' to '6' fro in '4' deeps, '458' d'249' in '4' bottom'759' blue, ru'50'd '240'y levia'169's, s'429'-fish, '6' sharks; '6' '182' '85' '4' '777', '461'd, '776'ous '54'ings of '4' mascu'518' sea.
But '463' thus contrasting '31'in, '4' contrast '28' '146' in s'97'es '6' s'97'ows '327'; '200' '149' '562'ed '63'; it '28' '146' '4' '640', as it '85', '7' distingui'50'd '116'.
Aloft, '46' a royal czar '6' king, '4' sun '562'ed '631' '14' gentle '769' to '14' b'261' '6' rolling sea; '140' as b'852' to g'267'. And at '4' girdling '518' of '4' horizon, a soft '6' tremulous motion—'344' '333' '43' at '4' Equator—de'23'ed '4' fond, throbbing '395', '4' loving alarms, '31' '265' '4' '719' b'852' '417' '49' bosom '170'.
Tied up '6' twisted; gnarled '6' k'23'ted '31' wrinkles; haggardly firm '6' unyielding; '90' '495' glo'768'g '46' coals, '7' s'773' glow in '4' a'50's of ruin; untotte'847' Ahab s'111'd '17'th in '4' c'819'ess of '4' morn; lifting '90' splinte'796' hel'559' of a brow to '4' '807' '283''s '17'e'342' of heaven.
Oh, immortal infancy, '6' innocency of '4' azure! Invisible '768'ged cr'545'ures '7' frolic '34' round us! Sweet '497'hood of '769' '6' sky! '60' oblivious '85' ye of '261' Ahab's '452'-coiled woe! But so '19' I '333' '105' Miriam '6' Martha, laughing-'784'd elves, heed'759'ly gambol '187' '238' '261' '284'e; sporting '31' '4' circle of singed locks '265' grew on '4' marge of '7' burnt-'44' crater of '90' brain.
Slowly crossing '4' deck '83' '4' s'537'tle, Ahab leaned '118' '4' '500' '6' '430'ed '60' '90' s'97'ow in '4' '604' sank '6' sank to '90' gaze, '4' '117' '6' '4' '117' '7' he strove to pierce '4' pro'427'dity. But '4' '112'ly aromas in '7' enchanted '769' '64' at '181' '562' to dispel, '17' a mo'508't, '4' '51'kerous '124' in '90' soul. That '431', '280' '769', '7' '768''96' sky, '64' at '181' stroke '6' '324'ess '58'; '4' '761'-m'173' '296', so '192' cruel—'17'bidding—'56' threw affectionate arms round '90' stubborn neck, '6' '64' '562' to jo'1'sly sob '118' '58', as if '118' '63', '7' '60''167' wilful '6' er'847', '50' '87' '332' '156' it in '49' '374' to '550' '6' to b'759'. From ben'545'h '90' slouched hat Ahab '705'ped a tear '155' '4' sea; nor '64' '34' '4' Pacific contain '375' wealth as '7' '63' wee '705'.
Starbuck '282' '4' '261' '128'; '282' '58', '60' he heavily leaned '118' '4' '500'; '6' he '562'ed to '230' in '90' '249' '354' '374' '4' mea'115''759' sobbing '7' stole '44' of '4' centre of '4' serenity '187'. C'36'ful '23' to '678' '58', or be '23''972'd by '58', he '332' drew '958' to '58', '6' s'111'd t'43'.
Ahab '391'ed.
"Starbuck!"
"Sir."
"Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild '768'd, '6' a mild '262' sky. On '375' a '183'—'131' '137' '375' a '584'ness as '14'—I struck my '171' whale—a '311'-harpo'63'er of '879'een!

That hazard sh'34' '23' be thine. No, no! '23' '31' '4' '458' '170' '179' I '66' in '7' '784'!"
"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! gr'6' '261' '374', '180' '34'! '65' '134' '138' '63' '145' c'129'e to '7' '413'd fish! A'103' '31' me! '123' us fly '182' '314'ly '604's! '123' us '179'!

I '54', '284', '69' '19' '96' '375' mild blue '433', '140' as '14', in Nantucket."
"T'84' '19', '69' '19'. I '19' '333' '116'—'96' summer '433' in '4' '339'. Ab'44' '14' '75'—'89', it is '90' noon nap '56'—'4' '311' vivaciously '830's; '421's up in '515'; '6' '90' m'173' '81's '58' of me, of '51'nibal '261' me; '60' I am ab'937' upon '4' deep, '33' '76' '332' '67' '78' to '725' '58' '158'."
"'Tis my Mary, my Mary '916'! She '449'd '7' my '311', e'131' '339', '134' be '324'ried to '4' hill to '756' '4' '171' glimpse of '90' '233''s sail!

But Ahab's glance '28' averted; '46' a b'703'ed fruit tree he shook, '6' cast '90' '181', cinde'796' apple to '4' soil.
"What is it, '11' '275''759', inscrut'473', un'987'ly '124' is it; '11' cozening, hidden lord '6' master, '6' cruel, remorse'759' emperor com'128'ds me; '7' '485' '34' natural lovings '6' '192'ings, I so '184' pushing, '6' crowding, '6' jamming '302' on '34' '4' '75'; reck'759'ly '380' me '325' to do '11' in my '249' proper, natural '374', I durst '23' so '137' as d'36'? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or '94', '7' lifts '14' arm? But if '4' '164' sun '367' '23' of '58''968'; '33' is as an err'6'-'311' in heaven; nor '63' single star '51' revolve, '33' by '96' invisible '637'; '60' '98' '51' '14' '63' sm'34' '374' '942'; '14' '63' sm'34' brain '54' '147's; un'759' God '185' '7' '942'ing, '185' '7' '54'ing, '185' '7' '565', '6' '23' I.

But it is a mild, mild '768'd, '6' a mild '262' sky; '6' '4' '769' smells '56', as if it blew '83' a '458'-'170' meadow; '69' '19' '91' '380' hay '96'w'43' '447' '4' slopes of '4' Andes, Starbuck, '6' '4' m'969'rs '36' '503'ing among '4' '212'-m'249' hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we '60' we '289', we '34' '503' at '181' on '4' field. Sleep? Aye, '6' rust amid greenness; as '181' '407''s scy'4's flung d'249', '6' '269' in '4' '499'-'537' swaths—Starbuck!"
But blanched to a corpse's hue '31' desp'769', '4' Mate '97' stolen '170'.
Ahab crossed '4' deck to gaze '118' on '4' '173' '500'; '33' '319'ed at '149' reflected, '950'ed '495' in '4' '604' t'43'. Fed'34'ah '28' motion'759'ly leaning '118' '4' '276' rail.




CHAPTER 133. The C'129'e—First Day.

That '168', in '4' mid-'430', '74' '4' '261' '128'—as '90' wont at intervals—'761'ped '17'th '83' '4' s'537'tle in '265' he leaned, '6' '277' to '90' pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust '44' '90' '352' fiercely, snuffing up '4' sea '769' as a sagacious ship's '766' '76', in dra'768'g nigh to '96' '960''960'ous isle. He decla'796' '7' a whale '259' be '958'. Soon '7' peculiar odor, so'559'imes to a '164' distance '145'n '17'th by '4' '565' sperm whale, '28' palp'473' to '34' '4' '430'; nor '28' '138' mariner '715'd '74', '180' inspecting '4' com'962', '6' '98' '4' '766'-vane, '6' '98' as'979'ing '4' precise bea'847' of '4' odor as '958'ly as '622', Ahab rapidly '619'ed '4' ship's '239' to be s'703'ly alte'796', '6' '4' sail to be shor'606'ed.
The a'924' policy dictating '182' '367''508'ts '28' sufficiently vindicated at '183''448', by '4' sight of a '192' sleek on '4' sea directly '6' lengthwise '531', smooth as oil, '6' resembling in '4' pl'545'ed '604'y wrinkles b'619'ing it, '4' poli'50'd '559''34'ic-'46' marks of '96' swift tide-rip, at '4' '843' of a deep, rapid stream.
"Man '4' mast-'342's! C'34' '34' '524'!"
Th'447'ing '31' '4' '33'ts of '291' '801''515' '524'pikes on '4' '17'ecastle deck, Daggoo ro'364'd '4' '503'ers '31' '375' judg'508't claps '7' '69' '562'ed to exhale '83' '4' s'537'tle, so instantaneously '64' '69' appear '31' '238' '945' in '238' '524'.
"What d'ye '66'?" cried Ahab, flat'606'ing '90' '352' to '4' sky.
"No'124', no'124' '284'!" '28' '4' '602' hailing d'249' in reply.
"T'g'34'ant sails!—stunsails! alow '6' aloft, '6' on '312' '500's!"
All sail '213' '451', he '56' cast loose '4' '139'-'518', reserved '17' s'103'ing '58' to '4' main royal-mast '342'; '6' in a '360' mo'508'ts '69' '85' hoisting '58' t'479''49', '74', '313' '33' '149' thirds of '4' '103' aloft, '6' '313' pee'847' '531' '209' '4' horizontal va'51'cy '592'ween '4' main-'739'-sail '6' '739'-g'34'ant-sail, he raised a gull-'46' cry in '4' '769'. "T'43' '50' blows!—t'43' '50' blows! A hump '46' a s'56'-hill! It is Moby Dick!"
Fi'796' by '4' cry '265' '562'ed simultaneously '645' up by '4' '291' '73'-'44's, '4' '508' on deck ru'50'd to '4' rigging to be'330' '4' famous whale '69' '97' so '192' '91' pursuing. Ahab '97' '56' gained '90' final perch, '96' '908' above '4' '173' '73'-'44's, Tashtego st'6'ing '22' ben'545'h '58' on '4' cap of '4' '739'-g'34'ant-mast, so '7' '4' Indian's '342' '28' al'344' on a level '31' Ahab's heel. From '14' h'879' '4' whale '28' '56' '333' '96' mile or so '531', at e'131' roll of '4' sea revealing '90' '530' sparkling hump, '6' regularly jetting '90' silent sp'44' '155' '4' '769'. To '4' c'796'ulous mariners it '562'ed '4' '276' silent sp'44' '69' '97' so '192' '414' beheld in '4' moonlit Atlantic '6' Indian Oceans.
"And '64' '697' of ye '66' it '165'?" cried Ahab, hailing '4' perched '508' '34' '187' '58'.
"I '282' '58' al'344' '7' '276' instant, '284', '7' Captain Ahab '64', '6' I cried '44'," '136' Tashtego.
"Not '4' '276' instant; '23' '4' '276'—no, '4' doubloon is '462', Fate reserved '4' doubloon '17' me. I '146'; '697' of ye '87' '19' raised '4' W'479'e Whale '171'. T'43' '50' blows!—t'43' '50' blows!—t'43' '50' blows! T'43' '158'!—t'43' '158'!" he cried, in '192'-drawn, linge'847', '559'hodic t'913', attuned to '4' gradual pro'192'ings of '4' whale's visible jets. "He's '45' to '602'! In stunsails! D'249' '739'-g'34'ant-sails! St'6' by '291' boats. '197' Starbuck, '219', '235' on board, '6' '184' '4' ship. Helm t'43'! Luff, luff a '378'! So; steady, '128', steady! T'43' go flukes! No, no; '146' '751' '604'! All '325' '4' boats t'43'? St'6' by, st'6' by! L'969'r me, '197' Starbuck; l'969'r, l'969'r,—quick, quicker!" '6' he slid '209' '4' '769' to '4' deck.
"He is '342'ing '688' to lee'869'd, '284'," cried Stubb, "'40' '170' '83' us; '51''23' '19' '333' '4' ship '332'."
"Be dumb, '128'! St'6' by '4' braces! Hard d'249' '4' helm!—brace up! Shiver '49'!—shiver '49'!—So; '35' '7'! Boats, boats!"
Soon '34' '4' boats '33' Starbuck's '85' '705'ped; '34' '4' boat-sails '451'—'34' '4' paddles p'666'; '31' rippling swiftness, '855'ing to lee'869'd; '6' Ahab '342'ing '4' on'451'. A pale, '548'-glimmer lit up Fed'34'ah's sunken '495'; a hideous motion gnawed '90' '843'.
Like noise'759' nautilus s'245's, '238' '703' prows sped '209' '4' sea; '33' '146' slowly '69' nea'796' '4' foe. As '69' nea'796' '58', '4' ocean grew s'773' '117' smooth; '562'ed dra'768'g a '324'pet '118' '716' waves; '562'ed a noon-meadow, so serenely it sp'504'. At length '4' br'545'h'759' hunter '246' so nigh '90' '562'ingly unsuspecting prey, '7' '90' '797' dazzling hump '28' distinctly visible, sliding '549' '4' sea as if an iso'399'd '124', '6' continu'34'y '451' in a revolving '847' of '178'st, fleecy, greenish foam. He '282' '4' vast, '745' wrinkles of '4' s'703'ly projecting '342' beyond. Be'17'e it, '458' '44' on '4' soft Turkish-rugged '604's, '277' '4' g'919'ening '691' s'97'ow '83' '90' b'937', milky '17'e'342', a '886'al rippling '412''597'y ac'624'ing '4' s'97'e; '6' '528', '4' blue '604's inter'397'ably fl'969'd '118' '155' '4' '772' v'34'ey of '90' steady '830'; '6' on ei'4'r h'6' b'40' bubbles arose '6' '725'd by '90' '500'. But '182' '85' '785'n '158' by '4' '703' toes of hund'796's of gay fowl softly fea'4''847' '4' sea, alternate '31' '238' fitful f'703'; '6' '46' to '96' flag-staff rising '83' '4' '684'ted hull of an argosy, '4' t'34' '33' shatte'796' pole of a recent lance projected '83' '4' '691' whale's '78'; '6' at intervals '63' of '4' cloud of soft-toed fowls h'118'ing, '6' to '6' fro skimming '46' a '51'opy '118' '4' fish, silently perched '6' rocked on '14' pole, '4' '192' tail fea'4'rs streaming '46' pennons.
A gentle jo'1'sness—a '240'y mildness of repose in swiftness, invested '4' gliding whale. Not '4' '691' bull Jupiter swimming '170' '31' ravi'50'd Europa clinging to '90' graceful horns; '90' '112'ly, lee'847' '495' '500''103's in'606't upon '4' maid; '31' smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling '688' '17' '4' nuptial b'969'r in Crete; '23' Jove, '23' '7' '164' majesty Supreme! '64' sur'962' '4' glorified W'479'e Whale as he so divinely swam.
On '356' soft '500'—coincident '31' '4' '348'ed s'35', '7' '33' '336' '568' '58', '98' fl'969'd so wide '170'—on '356' b'40' '500', '4' whale '50'd '141' enticings. No '683' t'43' '97' '91' '96' among '4' hunters '94' '275''759'ly t'868'sported '6' '34'u'796' by '34' '14' serenity, '97' ventu'796' to '652'ail it; '33' '97' fat'34'y '295' '7' '935'ude '33' '4' vesture of torna'185'. Yet '804', enticing '804', oh, whale! thou glidest on, to '34' '94' '17' '4' '171' '75' '784' '4'e, no '301' '60' '128'y in '7' '276' '103' thou '289''st '19' bejuggled '6' destroyed '165'.
And thus, '209' '4' serene t'868'quillities of '4' tropical sea, among waves '94'se h'6'-clappings '85' susp'398'ed by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick '367'd on, s'773' '31''956' '83' sight '4' '597' terrors of '90' submerged t'366'k, '797'ly hiding '4' wrenched hideousness of '90' jaw. But '358' '4' '17'e '348' of '58' slowly rose '83' '4' '604'; '17' an instant '90' '251' marbleized '618' '17'med a '530' arch, '46' Virginia's Natural B'885', '6' '869'ningly waving '90' banne'796' flukes in '4' '769', '4' gr'6' '152' revealed '58''968', '602'ed, '6' '277' '44' of sight. H'118'ingly halting, '6' dipping on '4' '768'g, '4' '691' sea-fowls '192'ingly linge'796' '118' '4' agitated pool '7' he '269'.
With oars apeak, '6' paddles d'249', '4' '50'ets of '238' sails adrift, '4' '291' boats '56' s'773'y floated, a'483' Moby Dick's reappea'868'ce.
"An '612'," '136' Ahab, st'6'ing rooted in '90' boat's stern; '6' he gazed beyond '4' whale's '226', to'869'ds '4' dim blue spaces '6' wide wooing va'51'cies to lee'869'd. It '28' '146' an instant; '17' '158' '90' '495' '562'ed whirling round in '90' '342' as he swept '4' '604'y circle. The breeze '56' fre'50'ned; '4' sea began to s'35'.
"The birds!—'4' birds!" cried Tashtego.
In '192' Indian file, as '74' '49'ons '101' '768'g, '4' '691' birds '85' '56' '34' f'666' to'869'ds Ahab's boat; '6' '74' '31'in a '360' yards began flutte'847' '118' '4' '604' t'43', wheeling round '6' round, '31' jo'1's, '741'ant cries. Their vision '28' keener '169' '128''s; Ahab '87' disc'118' no '659' in '4' sea. But suddenly as he pee'796' d'249' '6' d'249' '155' '716' depths, he pro'295'ly '282' a '691' '565' spot no '201'ger '169' a '691' weasel, '31' '533' celerity uprising, '6' magnifying as it rose, '773' it '391'ed, '6' '98' t'43' '85' plainly revealed '149' '192' crooked rows of '691', g'919'ening teeth, floating up '83' '4' undisc'118''473' bottom. It '28' Moby Dick's '422' '843' '6' scrolled jaw; '90' vast, s'97''969'd bulk s'773' '499' bl'398'ing '31' '4' blue of '4' sea. The glitte'847' '843' yawned ben'545'h '4' boat '46' an '422'-doo'796' marble tomb; '6' '631' '63' '500''192' sweep '31' '90' stee'847' oar, Ahab whirled '4' craft a'500' '83' '14' tre'508'dous apparition. Then, c'34'ing upon Fed'34'ah to '397' '226's '31' '58', '277' '17''869'd to '4' bows, '6' seizing Perth's harpoon, com'128'ded '90' crew to grasp '238' oars '6' st'6' by to stern.
Now, by '385' of '14' '75'ly spinning round '4' boat upon '716' axis, '716' bow, by anticipation, '28' '721'e to '352' '4' whale's '342' '313' '332' '447' '604'. But as if perceiving '14' stratagem, Moby Dick, '31' '7' malicious in'81'igence ascri'515' to '58', '500'lingly t'868's'519'ted '58''968', as it '85', in an instant, '855'ing '90' pl'545'ed '342' lengthwise ben'545'h '4' boat.
Through '6' '209'; '209' e'131' '519'k '6' '356' rib, it thrilled '17' an instant, '4' whale obliquely '666' on '90' '78', in '4' '128'ner of a '437'ing shark, slowly '6' '174'ingly '409' '716' bows '597' '31'in '90' '843', so '7' '4' '192', narrow, scrolled l'969'r jaw curled '530' up '155' '4' '422' '769', '6' '63' of '4' teeth '808' in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-'691' of '4' in'500' of '4' jaw '28' '31'in '578' inches of Ahab's '342', '6' r'356'ed '530'er '169' '7'. In '14' attitude '4' W'479'e Whale '56' shook '4' s'703' cedar as a mildly cruel cat '49' mo'364'. With unastoni'50'd '495' Fed'34'ah gazed, '6' crossed '90' arms; '33' '4' tiger-yellow crew '85' tumbling '118' '356' '173''s '342's to gain '4' utter'344' stern.
And '56', '313' '312' e'181'ic '723'wales '85' sp'847'ing in '6' '44', as '4' whale d'34'ied '31' '4' doomed craft in '14' d'779'ish '103'; '6' '83' '90' '618' '213' submerged ben'545'h '4' boat, he '87' '23' be darted at '83' '4' bows, '17' '4' bows '85' al'344' in'500' of '58', as it '85'; '6' '313' '4' '173' boats involuntarily pa'364'd, as '165' a quick crisis im'622' to '31'st'6', '98' it '28' '7' mono'128'iac Ahab, furious '31' '14' tantalizing vicinity of '90' foe, '265' '226'd '58' '34' a'349' '6' '148''759' in '4' '131' jaws he '413'd; frenzied '31' '34' '14', he seized '4' '192' b'63' '31' '90' naked '524', '6' wildly strove to wrench it '83' '716' gripe. As '56' he thus vainly strove, '4' jaw slipped '83' '58'; '4' frail '723'wales bent in, collapsed, '6' snapped, as '312' jaws, '46' an enormous '50'ars, sliding fur'4'r aft, '437' '4' craft comp'123'ely in twain, '6' locked '116'selves '692' '158' in '4' sea, mid'103' '592'ween '4' '149' floating wrecks. These floated a'500', '4' '785'n '398's drooping, '4' crew at '4' stern-wreck clinging to '4' '723'wales, '6' striving to '330' '692' to '4' oars to lash '116' across.
At '7' preluding mo'508't, ere '4' boat '28' '332' snapped, Ahab, '4' '171' to perceive '4' whale's in'606't, by '4' crafty upraising of '90' '342', a '367''508't '7' loosed '90' '330' '17' '4' '75'; at '7' mo'508't '90' h'6' '97' '721'e '63' final ef'17't to push '4' boat '44' of '4' '437'e. But '146' slipping fur'4'r '155' '4' whale's '843', '6' tilting '118' '500''103's as it slipped, '4' boat '97' shaken '141' '90' '330' on '4' jaw; spilled '58' '44' of it, as he leaned to '4' push; '6' so he '947' flat-'352'd upon '4' sea.
Ripplingly '31'dra'768'g '83' '90' prey, Moby Dick '56' lay at a '105' distance, vertic'34'y thrusting '90' ob'192' '691' '342' up '6' d'249' in '4' '899'ows; '6' at '4' '276' '75' slowly revolving '90' '251' spindled '618'; so '7' '74' '90' vast wrinkled '17'e'342' rose—'96' t'277'y or '117' '908' '44' of '4' '604'—'4' '56' rising s'35's, '31' '34' '238' confluent waves, dazzlingly '785' '485' it; vindictively tossing '238' shive'796' spray s'773' '530'er '155' '4' '769'.* So, in a gale, '4' '33' '499' baffled Channel '899'ows '146' recoil '83' '4' base of '4' Eddyst'63', triumphantly to '118'leap '716' summit '31' '238' scud.
*T'90' motion is peculiar to '4' sperm whale. It receives '716' de'659'ation (pitchpoling) '83' '716' '213' '46'ned to '7' preliminary up-'6'-d'249' poise of '4' whale-lance, in '4' exercise c'34'ed pitchpoling, previously descri'515'. By '14' motion '4' whale '259' '258' '6' '344' comprehensively view w'413'ver objects '289' be encircling '58'.
But '358' resuming '90' horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round '6' round '4' wrecked crew; '500''103's churning '4' '604' in '90' vengeful '830', as if lashing '58''968' up to s'773' an'173' '6' '117' '314'ly '652'ault. The sight of '4' splinte'796' boat '562'ed to '721'den '58', as '4' '593' of grapes '6' mulberries cast '165' Antiochus's elephants in '4' '560' of Maccabees. Mean'313' Ahab '499' smot'43'd in '4' foam of '4' whale's insolent tail, '6' '111' '137' of a cripple to swim,—'463' he '87' s'773' '184' afloat, '140' in '4' '374' of '375' a whirlpool as '7'; '148''759' Ahab's '342' '28' '333', '46' a tossed bubble '265' '4' '402' '365' shock '240' burst. From '4' boat's frag'508'tary stern, Fed'34'ah incuriously '6' mildly '784'd '58'; '4' clinging crew, at '4' '173' drifting '398', '87' '23' succor '58'; '117' '169' '243' '28' it '17' '116' to '73' to '116'selves. For so revolvingly app'34'ing '28' '4' W'479'e Whale's aspect, '6' so '519'etarily swift '4' '167'-contr'735'ing circles he '721'e, '7' he '562'ed horizont'34'y swooping upon '116'. And '463' '4' '173' boats, unharmed, s'773' h'118'ed '321' by; s'773' '69' da'796' '23' '732' '155' '4' eddy to strike, lest '7' '134' be '4' '659'al '17' '4' instant destruction of '4' jeopardized cast'170's, Ahab '6' '34'; nor in '7' '390' '87' '69' '116'selves '274' to escape. With straining '495', '98', '69' remained on '4' '44'er edge of '4' direful z'63', '94'se centre '97' '56' be'67' '4' '261' '128''s '342'.
Mean'75', '83' '4' beginning '34' '14' '97' '91' descried '83' '4' ship's mast '342's; '6' squa'847' '49' yards, '50' '97' borne d'249' upon '4' scene; '6' '28' '56' so nigh, '7' Ahab in '4' '604' hailed '49'!—"Sail on '4'"—'33' '7' mo'508't a '448'ing sea da'50'd on '58' '83' Moby Dick, '6' whelmed '58' '17' '4' '75'. But struggling '44' of it '158', '6' chancing to rise on a t'969''847' c'426', he sh'44'ed,—"Sail on '4' whale!—Drive '58' '141'!"
The Pequod's prows '85' '378'ed; '6' '448'ing up '4' charmed circle, '50' effectu'34'y '348'ed '4' '691' whale '83' '90' victim. As he sullenly swam '141', '4' boats flew to '4' rescue.
Dragged '155' Stubb's boat '31' '593'-s'576', blinded '495', '4' '691' brine caking in '90' wrinkles; '4' '192' '606'sion of Ahab's bodily strength '64' crack, '6' '148''759'ly he yielded to '90' '618''s doom: '17' a '75', '666' '34' cru'50'd in '4' bottom of Stubb's boat, '46' '63' trodden '447' foot of '49'ds of elephants. Far inl'6', '275''759' wails '246' '83' '58', as deso'399' '602's '83' '44' ravines.
But '14' in'606''421'y of '90' physical prostration '64' '33' so '137' '4' '117' abbreviate it. In an instant's com'962', '164' '374's so'559'imes condense to '63' deep pang, '4' sum total of '200' sh'34'ow '684's '207'ly diff'364'd '209' feebler '508''s '251' '349's. And so, '375' '374's, '463' summary in '356' '63' suffe'847'; s'773', if '4' '152's decree it, in '238' '139'-'75' aggregate a '251' age of woe, '94'lly '721'e up of instantaneous in'606''421'ies; '17' '140' in '238' '378''759' centres, '200' noble natures contain '4' '797' circumferences of inferior souls.
"The harpoon," '136' Ahab, '499' '103' rising, '6' draggingly leaning on '63' b'398'ed arm—"is it '564'?"
"Aye, '284', '17' it '28' '23' darted; '14' is it," '136' Stubb, sho'768'g it.
"Lay it '165' me;—'138' '376'ing '508'?"
"One, '149', '291', '492', '401';—t'43' '85' '401' oars, '284', '6' '43' '36' '401' '508'."
"That's '68'.—Help me, '128'; I '392' to st'6'. So, so, I '66' '58'! t'43'! t'43'! '45' to lee'869'd s'773'; '11' a leaping sp'44'!—H'6's '141' '83' me! The eternal sap '366's up in Ahab's b'913' '158'! Set '4' sail; '44' oars; '4' helm!"
It is of'606' '4' '390' '7' '74' a boat is stove, '716' crew, '213' '512'ed up by an'173' boat, '148' to '176' '7' '347' boat; '6' '4' c'129'e is thus continued '31' '11' is c'34'ed double-banked oars. It '28' thus '56'. But '4' added '637' of '4' boat '64' '23' equal '4' added '637' of '4' whale, '17' he '562'ed to '19' treble-banked '90' e'131' fin; swimming '31' a velo'709' '265' plainly s'60'ed, '7' if '56', '447' '182' circumstances, pu'50'd on, '4' c'129'e '72' '831' an in'780' pro'192'ed, if '23' a '274''759' '63'; nor '87' '138' crew '398'ure '17' so '192' a period, '375' an unintermitted, in'606'se straining at '4' oar; a '124' '960'ely toler'473' '146' in '96' '63' brief vicis'421'ude. The ship '716'elf, '98', as it so'559'imes '308's, '141'e'796' '4' '344' promising intermediate '410' of '118''409' '4' c'129'e. Accordingly, '4' boats '56' '721'e '17' '49', '6' '85' '358' s'103'ed up to '238' c'868'es—'4' '149' '348's of '4' wrecked boat '305' '91' previously secu'796' by '49'—'6' '98' hoisting e'131''124' to '49' '500', '6' stacking '49' '51'vas '530' up, '6' '500''103's '44'stretching it '31' stun-sails, '46' '4' double-jointed '768'gs of an albatross; '4' Pequod bore d'249' in '4' lee'869'd '830' of Moby-Dick. At '4' '35' '677', '559'hodic intervals, '4' whale's glitte'847' sp'44' '28' regularly announced '83' '4' '128'ned mast-'342's; '6' '74' he '72' be reported as '22' g'63' d'249', Ahab '72' '101' '4' '75', '6' '98' pacing '4' deck, binnacle-'430' in h'6', so '358' as '4' '181' '347' of '4' '34'otted '612' expi'796', '90' '915' '28' '299'.—"Whose is '4' doubloon '56'? D'ye '66' '58'?" '6' if '4' reply '28', No, '284'! '688''103' he com'128'ded '116' to lift '58' to '90' perch. In '14' '103' '4' '183' wore on; Ahab, '56' aloft '6' motion'759'; anon, un'426'ingly pacing '4' '519'ks.
As he '28' thus '459'ing, utte'847' no '602', '722' to hail '4' '508' aloft, or to bid '116' hoist a sail s'773' '530'er, or to sp'504' '63' to a s'773' '164'er b'504'th—thus to '6' fro pacing, ben'545'h '90' slouched hat, at e'131' '391' he '962'ed '90' '249' wrecked boat, '265' '97' '91' '705'ped upon '4' quarter-deck, '6' lay t'43' r'167'sed; '785'n bow to shatte'796' stern. At '181' he pa'364'd '165' it; '6' as in an '287' '118'-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds '76' so'559'imes sail across, so '118' '4' '261' '128''s '352' t'43' '56' stole '96' '375' added gloom as '14'.
Stubb '282' '58' pa'364'; '6' '760' in'606'ding, '23' vainly, '463', to evince '90' '249' unabated '17'titude, '6' thus '184' up a valiant '226' in '90' Captain's '241', he advanced, '6' '784'ing '4' wreck exclaimed—"The '14'tle '4' '652' ref'364'd; it pricked '90' '843' '111' keenly, '284'; ha! ha!"
"What soul'759' '124' is '14' '7' laughs '165' a wreck? Man, '128'! '64' I '23' k'56' '4'e brave as fear'759' '522' ('6' as mechanical) I '87' '746' thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh '134' be '299' '165' a wreck."
"Aye, '284'," '136' Starbuck dra'768'g '958', "'tis a solemn sight; an o'508', '6' an ill '63'."
"O'508'? o'508'?—'4' dictionary! If '4' '152's '54' to '613' '44''40' to '128', '69' '76' hon'119'ably '613' '44''40'; '23' shake '238' '342's, '6' '145' an '261' wives' '967'ling hint.—Beg'63'! Ye '149' '36' '4' oppo'421'e poles of '63' '124'; Starbuck is Stubb r'167'sed, '6' Stubb is Starbuck; '6' ye '149' '36' '34' '128''207'; '6' Ahab st'6's al'63' among '4' '827's of '4' '151'd '987', nor '152's nor '508' '90' neighbors! C'261', '690'—I shiver!—How '56'? Aloft t'43'! D'ye '66' '58'? Sing '44' '17' e'131' sp'44', '463' he sp'44' '606' '464' a '347'!"
The '183' '28' '958'ly d'63'; '146' '4' hem of '90' g'261'en robe '28' rustling. Soon, it '28' al'344' '967', '33' '4' '73'-'44' '508' s'773' remained un'451'.
"Can't '66' '4' sp'44' '56', '284';—'111' '967'"—cried a '915' '83' '4' '769'.
"How '342'ing '74' '181' '333'?"
"As '165', '284',—'688' to lee'869'd."
"Good! he '76' travel sl'969'r '56' 'tis '168'. D'249' royals '6' '739'-g'34'ant stun-sails, '197' Starbuck.

A'103' '56'!—'4' deck is thine, '284'!"
And so '99'ing, he '226'd '58''968' '499' '103' '31'in '4' s'537'tle, '6' slouching '90' hat, s'111'd t'43' '773' dawn, '722' '74' at intervals ro'970' '58''968' to '66' '60' '4' '168' wore on.




CHAPTER 134. The C'129'e—Second Day.

At '183'-'448', '4' '291' mast-'342's '85' punctu'34'y '128'ned afresh.
"D'ye '66' '58'?" cried Ahab '180' '34'o'768'g a '105' space '17' '4' '703' to sp'504'.
"See no'124', '284'."

The ship tore on; '568' '375' a furrow in '4' sea as '74' a '51'non-b'34', mis'708', be'67's a plough-'904' '6' '391's up '4' level field.
"By salt '6' hemp!" cried Stubb, "'33' '14' swift motion of '4' deck creeps up '63''s legs '6' tingles at '4' '374'. T'90' ship '6' I '36' '149' brave '947'ows!—Ha, ha!

"T'43' '50' blows—'50' blows!—'50' blows!—'40' '531'!" '28' '56' '4' mast-'342' cry.
"Aye, aye!" cried Stubb, "I k'212' it—ye '51''t escape—blow on '6' split y'119' sp'44', O whale! '4' '721' fi'398' '58''968' is '180' ye! blow y'119' trump—b'919'er y'119' lungs!—Ahab '76' dam '141' y'119' '593', as a miller '472's '90' '604'gate upon '4' stream!"
And Stubb '64' '33' '613' '44' '17' '35' nigh '34' '7' crew. The frenzies of '4' c'129'e '97' by '14' '75' '176'ed '116' bubblingly up, '46' '261' '768'e '176'ed a'212'.

The h'6' of Fate '97' snatched '34' '238' souls; '6' by '4' stir'847' perils of '4' previous '183'; '4' rack of '4' '536' '168''s suspense; '4' '950'ed, unfea'847', blind, reck'759' '103' in '265' '238' wild craft '277' plunging to'869'ds '716' f'666' mark; by '34' '182' '124's, '238' '374's '85' bowled '549'.

T'84' '85' '63' '128', '23' thirty. For as '4' '63' ship '7' held '116' '34'; '463' it '28' '186' to'42''49' of '34' contrasting '124's—oak, '6' maple, '6' pine wood; iron, '6' pitch, '6' hemp—'332' '34' '182' '868' '155' '356' '173' in '4' '63' concrete hull, '265' s'576' on '716' '103', '312' balanced '6' directed by '4' '192' central keel; '140' so, '34' '4' individualities of '4' crew, '14' '128''s valor, '7' '128''s fear; guilt '6' guiltiness, '34' varieties '85' welded '155' '63'ness, '6' '85' '34' directed to '7' fatal goal '265' Ahab '238' '63' lord '6' keel '64' '378' to.
The rigging '349'd. The mast-'342's, '46' '4' '739's of t'34' palms, '85' '44'sp'504'ingly tufted '31' arms '6' legs. Clinging to a spar '31' '63' h'6', '96' r'356'ed '17'th '4' '173' '31' impatient wavings; '173's, s'97'ing '238' '495' '83' '4' vivid sun'703', sat '458' '44' on '4' rocking yards; '34' '4' spars in '597' bea'847' of mortals, '325' '6' ripe '17' '238' fate. Ah! '60' '69' s'773' strove '209' '7' infinite blueness to '66'k '44' '4' '124' '7' '240' destroy '116'!
"Why sing ye '23' '44' '17' '58', if ye '66' '58'?" cried Ahab, '74', '180' '4' lapse of '96' '294's '317' '4' '171' cry, no '117' '97' '91' '299'. "S'103' me up, '508'; ye '19' '91' deceived; '23' Moby Dick casts '63' odd jet '7' '103', '6' '98' disappears."
It '28' '140' so; in '238' '342''192' eagerness, '4' '508' '97' mis'645' '96' '173' '124' '17' '4' whale-sp'44', as '4' '140't '716'elf '358' '831'd; '17' '321'ly '97' Ahab r'356'ed '90' perch; '321'ly '28' '4' rope belayed to '716' pin on deck, '74' he struck '4' key-'23'e to an orchestra, '7' '721'e '4' '769' vibrate as '31' '4' combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant h'34'oo of thirty buckskin lungs '28' '299', as—'137' '958'er to '4' ship '169' '4' '226' of '4' imaginary jet, '759' '169' a mile '531'—Moby Dick bodily burst '155' view! For '23' by '138' '804' '6' indolent sp'44'ings; '23' by '4' peace'473' gush of '7' mystic fountain in '90' '342', '64' '4' W'479'e Whale '56' reveal '90' vicinity; '33' by '4' '458' '117' wondrous pheno'508'on of br'356'ing. Rising '31' '90' ut'344' velo'709' '83' '4' fur'4'st depths, '4' Sperm Whale thus booms '90' '797' bulk '155' '4' pure ele'508't of '769', '6' piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, s'60's '90' '226' to '4' distance of s'140' miles '6' '117'. In '200' mo'508'ts, '4' torn, enraged waves he shakes '141', '562' '90' '128'e; in '96' '390's, '14' br'356'ing is '90' '735' of defiance.
"T'43' '50' br'356'es! t'43' '50' br'356'es!" '28' '4' cry, as in '90' immeasur'473' brava'185' '4' W'479'e Whale tossed '58''968' salmon-'46' to Heaven. So suddenly '333' in '4' blue plain of '4' sea, '6' re'596'ved '485' '4' s'773' bluer margin of '4' sky, '4' spray '7' he raised, '17' '4' mo'508't, '155'lerably glitte'796' '6' gla'796' '46' a glacier; '6' s'111'd t'43' gradu'34'y fading '6' fading '170' '83' '716' '171' sparkling in'606''421'y, to '4' dim mistiness of an advancing s'60'er in a vale.
"Aye, br'356' y'119' '181' to '4' sun, Moby Dick!" cried Ahab, "thy '612' '6' thy harpoon '36' at h'6'!—D'249'! d'249' '34' of ye, '33' '63' '128' at '4' '17'e. The boats!—st'6' by!"
Un'241'ful of '4' tedious rope-ladders of '4' shrouds, '4' '508', '46' '855'ing stars, slid to '4' deck, by '4' iso'399'd '78''235's '6' halyards; '313' Ahab, '759' dartingly, '33' s'773' rapidly '28' '705'ped '83' '90' perch.
"L'969'r '170'," he cried, so '358' as he '97' r'356'ed '90' boat—a sp'36' '63', rigged '4' '180'noon previous. "'197' Starbuck, '4' ship is thine—'184' '170' '83' '4' boats, '33' '184' '958' '116'. L'969'r, '34'!"
As if to strike a quick terror '155' '116', by '14' '75' '213' '4' '171' '652'ailant '58''968', Moby Dick '97' '391'ed, '6' '28' '56' '260' '17' '4' '291' crews. Ahab's boat '28' central; '6' chee'847' '90' '508', he '163' '116' he '72' '101' '4' whale '342'-'6'-'342',—'7' is, '732' '688' up to '90' '17'e'342',—a '23' uncommon '124'; '17' '74' '31'in a '979' limit, '375' a '239' excludes '4' '260' on'451' '83' '4' whale's '500''192' vision. But ere '7' '452' limit '28' gained, '6' '313' '332' '34' '291' boats '85' plain as '4' ship's '291' masts to '90' '784'; '4' W'479'e Whale churning '58''968' '155' furious speed, al'344' in an instant as it '85', rushing among '4' boats '31' '422' jaws, '6' a lashing tail, '141'e'796' app'34'ing battle on e'131' '500'; '6' heed'759' of '4' irons darted at '58' '83' e'131' boat, '562'ed '146' in'606't on annihilating '356' separate '519'k of '265' '200' boats '85' '721'e. But skil'597'y '128'oeuv'796', incessantly wheeling '46' trained chargers in '4' field; '4' boats '17' a '313' eluded '58'; '463', at '464', '33' by a '519'k's b'504'th; '313' '34' '4' '75', Ahab's un'987'ly slogan tore e'131' '173' cry '33' '90' to sh'796's.
But at '181' in '90' untrace'473' evolutions, '4' W'479'e Whale so crossed '6' recrossed, '6' in a thous'6' '103's entangled '4' slack of '4' '291' '518's '56' '692' to '58', '7' '69' '17'eshor'606'ed, '6', of '116'selves, '869'ped '4' devoted boats to'869'ds '4' '519'ted irons in '58'; '463' '56' '17' a mo'508't '4' whale drew a'500' a '105', as if to r'34'y '17' a '117' tre'508'dous charge. Seizing '7' opportunity, Ahab '171' paid '44' '117' '518': '6' '98' '28' rapidly hauling '6' jerking in upon it '158'—'882' '7' '103' to disencumber it of '96' snarls—'74' lo!—a sight '117' savage '169' '4' embattled teeth of sharks!
Caught '6' twisted—corkscrewed in '4' mazes of '4' '518', loose harpoons '6' lances, '31' '34' '238' bristling '960'bs '6' '378's, '246' flashing '6' dripping up to '4' chocks in '4' bows of Ahab's boat. Only '63' '124' '87' be d'63'. Seizing '4' boat-knife, he critic'34'y r'356'ed '31'in—'209'—'6' '98', '327'—'4' rays of steel; dragged in '4' '518' beyond, '962'ed it, inboard, to '4' bows'128', '6' '98', tw'972' s'447'ing '4' rope '958' '4' chocks—'705'ped '4' intercepted fa'61' of steel '155' '4' sea; '6' '28' '34' '692' '158'. That instant, '4' W'479'e Whale '721'e a sudden rush among '4' remaining tangles of '4' '173' '518's; by so '143', irresistibly dragged '4' '117' '745' boats of Stubb '6' Fl'257' to'869'ds '90' flukes; da'50'd '116' to'42''49' '46' '149' rolling husks on a surf-bea'606' b'356', '6' '98', diving d'249' '155' '4' sea, disappea'796' in a boiling maelstrom, in '265', '17' a space, '4' odorous cedar chips of '4' wrecks '725'd round '6' round, '46' '4' grated nutmeg in a swiftly stir'796' bowl of punch.
While '4' '149' crews '85' '332' circling in '4' '604's, r'356'ing '44' '180' '4' revolving '518'-tubs, oars, '6' '173' floating furniture, '313' aslope '105' Fl'257' bob'515' up '6' d'249' '46' an empty vial, twitching '90' legs up'869'ds to escape '4' d'504'ed jaws of sharks; '6' Stubb '28' lustily singing '44' '17' '96' '63' to ladle '58' up; '6' '313' '4' '261' '128''s '518'—'56' '348'ing—'774'ted of '90' '732'ing '155' '4' creamy pool to rescue '94'm he '87';—in '7' wild simultaneousness of a thous'6' concreted perils,—Ahab's '332' unstricken boat '562'ed drawn up to'869'ds Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-'46', '855'ing perp'398'icularly '83' '4' sea, '4' W'479'e Whale da'50'd '90' b'937' '17'e'342' '485' '716' bottom, '6' '708' it, '391'ing '118' '6' '118', '155' '4' '769'; '773' it '947' '158'—'723'wale d'249''869'ds—'6' Ahab '6' '90' '508' struggled '44' '83' '447' it, '46' seals '83' a sea-'500' cave.
The '171' uprising mo'508'tum of '4' whale—modifying '716' direction as he struck '4' sur'352'—involuntarily launched '58' '549' it, to a '105' distance '83' '4' centre of '4' destruction he '97' '721'e; '6' '31' '90' '78' to it, he '56' lay '17' a mo'508't slowly '174'ing '31' '90' flukes '83' '500' to '500'; '6' '74''167' a stray oar, '437' of '519'k, '4' '402' chip or crumb of '4' boats '678'ed '90' skin, '90' tail swiftly drew '78', '6' '246' '500''103's smiting '4' sea. But '358', as if satisfied '7' '90' '176' '17' '7' '75' '28' d'63', he pu'50'd '90' pl'545'ed '17'e'342' '209' '4' ocean, '6' trailing '180' '58' '4' intertangled '518's, continued '90' lee'869'd '103' at a traveller's '559'hodic pace.
As '165', '4' at'606'tive ship '305' descried '4' '251' '535', '158' '246' bea'847' d'249' to '4' rescue, '6' '705'ping a boat, '512'ed up '4' floating mariners, tubs, oars, '6' w'413'ver '234' '87' be '808' at, '6' '564'ly l'6'ed '116' on '49' decks. Some sprained '134'ers, wrists, '6' ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons '6' lances; i'290'ric'473' intricacies of rope; shatte'796' oars '6' '519'ks; '34' '182' '85' t'43'; '33' no fatal or '140' '525' ill '562'ed to '19' bef'34'en '138' '63'. As '31' Fed'34'ah '4' '183' '165', so Ahab '28' '56' '295' grimly clinging to '90' boat's '785'n '499', '265' af'17'ded a comparatively '454' float; nor '64' it so exhaust '58' as '4' previous '183''s mishap.
But '74' he '28' '148'ed to '4' deck, '34' '495' '85' fas'606'ed upon '58'; as '861' of st'6'ing by '58''968' he s'773' '499'-hung upon '4' '134'er of Starbuck, '94' '97' thus '458' '91' '4' '17'e'344' to '652'ist '58'. His ivory leg '97' '91' snapped '141', '568' '33' '63' '940' sharp splinter.
"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis '584' to lean so'559'imes, be '4' leaner '94' he '76'; '6' '72' '261' Ahab '97' leaned of'606'er '169' he '129'."
"The ferrule '129' '23' s'111'd, '284'," '136' '4' '324'penter, '56' '260' up; "I '186' '68' '176' '155' '7' leg."
"But no b'913' '785'n, '284', I '274'," '136' Stubb '31' '354' c'336'rn.
"Aye! '6' '34' splinte'796' to '747's, Stubb!—d'ye '66' it.—But '140' '31' a '785'n b'63', '261' Ahab is un'678'ed; '6' I ac'893' no '565' b'63' of '462' '63' jot '117' me, '169' '14' '314' '63' '55' '387'. Nor '691' whale, nor '128', nor fi'398', '51' so '137' as graze '261' Ahab in '90' '249' proper '6' inaccessible '213'. Can '138' lead '678' yonder '983', '138' mast scrape yonder roof?—Aloft t'43'!

"Dead to lee'869'd, '284'."
"Up helm, '98'; pile on '4' sail '158', ship '184'ers! d'249' '4' '426' of '4' sp'36' boats '6' rig '116'—'197' Starbuck '170', '6' '259'er '4' boat's crews."
"Let me '171' '148' '4'e to'869'ds '4' bul'869'ks, '284'."
"Oh, oh, oh! '60' '14' splinter gores me '56'! Accursed fate! '7' '4' unconquer'473' captain in '4' soul '134' '19' '375' a craven mate!"
"Sir?"
"My '618', '128', '23' '4'e. Give me so'559'hing '17' a '51'e—t'43', '7' shive'796' lance '76' do. Muster '4' '508'. Surely I '19' '23' '333' '58' '332'. By heaven it '51''23' be!—'376'ing?—quick! c'34' '116' '34'."
The '261' '128''s hinted '147' '28' '354'. Upon '259'e'847' '4' '624', '4' Par'66' '28' '23' t'43'.
"The Par'66'!" cried Stubb—"he '259' '19' '91' '808' in—"
"The '751' vomit wrench '4'e!—'366' '34' of ye above, alow, cabin, '17'ecastle—'156' '58'—'23' g'63'—'23' g'63'!"
But quickly '69' re'391'ed to '58' '31' '4' tidings '7' '4' Par'66' '28' '56''43' to be '295'.
"Aye, '284'," '136' Stubb—"'808' among '4' tangles of y'119' '518'—I '147' I '282' '58' dragging '447'."
"My '518'! my '518'? G'63'?—g'63'? What '410' '7' '105' '429'?—What '548'-knell '847's in it, '7' '261' Ahab shakes as if he '85' '4' belfry. The harpoon, '111'!—toss '118' '4' litter t'43',—d'ye '66' it?—'4' '17'ged iron, '508', '4' '691' whale's—no, no, no,—b'919'e'796' fool! '14' h'6' '64' dart it!—'tis in '4' fish!—Aloft t'43'! Keep '58' nailed—Quick!—'34' '524' to '4' rigging of '4' boats—collect '4' oars—harpo'63'ers!

'82' '606' '464' girdle '4' unmeasu'796' globe; yea '6' dive '688' '209' it, '33' '82' slay '58' '332'!
"Gr'545' God! '33' '17' '63' single instant s'60' thy'968'," cried Starbuck; "n'167', n'167' wilt thou capture '58', '261' '128'—In '929'' '275' no '117' of '14', '55' '623' '169' d'779''s '721'ness. Two '433' c'129'ed; tw'972' stove to splinters; thy '131' leg '336' '117' snatched '83' '447' '4'e; thy '779' s'97'ow g'63'—'34' '68' angels mobbing '4'e '31' '869'nings:—
"What '117' '72'st thou '19'?—Sh'34' we '184' c'129'ing '14' '776'ous fish '773' he swamps '4' '181' '128'? Sh'34' we be dragged by '58' to '4' bottom of '4' sea? Sh'34' we be t'969'd by '58' to '4' infernal '296'? Oh, oh,—Impiety '6' blasphemy to hunt '58' '117'!"
"Starbuck, of '399' '114' '577' st'868'gely '367'd to '4'e; '167' '317' '7' '612' we '312' '282'—thou k'56''st '11', in '63' an'173''s '495'. But in '14' '301' of '4' whale, be '4' '569' of thy '352' to me as '4' palm of '14' h'6'—a lip'759', unf'545'u'796' blank. Ahab is '17' '167' Ahab, '128'. T'90' '251' '735''s immutably decreed. 'T'28' re'230'sed by '4'e '6' me a '899'ion '266' '165' '14' ocean rolled. Fool! I am '4' Fates' '596'u'606'ant; I '735' '447' '619's. Look thou, '447'ling! '7' thou ob'495't '462'.—St'6' round me, '508'. Ye '66' an '261' '128' '537' d'249' to '4' stump; leaning on a shive'796' lance; propped up on a l'63'ly foot. 'Tis Ahab—'90' '618''s '348'; '33' Ahab's soul's a centipede, '7' '367's upon a hund'796' legs. I '174' strained, '499' str'6'ed, as ropes '7' tow dismasted frigates in a gale; '6' I '289' '73' so. But ere I '448', ye'll '230' me crack; '6' '773' ye '230' '7', k'56' '7' Ahab's hawser tows '90' purpose '332'. Be'596've ye, '508', in '4' '124's c'34'ed o'508's? Then laugh aloud, '6' cry encore! For ere '69' dr'249', dr'249'ing '124's '76' tw'972' rise to '4' sur'352'; '98' rise '158', to sink '17' '167''117'. So '31' Moby Dick—'149' '433' '86' floated—'393' '76' be '4' third. Aye, '508', '540' rise '336' '117',—'33' '146' to sp'44' '90' '181'! D'ye '174' brave '508', brave?"
"As fear'759' '522'," cried Stubb.
"And as mechanical," mutte'796' Ahab. Then as '4' '508' '277' '17''869'd, he mutte'796' on: "The '124's c'34'ed o'508's! And '89'ter'183' I '649' '4' '276' to Starbuck t'43', c'336'rning my '785'n boat. Oh! '60' valiantly I '66'k to '698' '44' of '173's' '374's '11''s clinched so '692' in '462'!—The Par'66'—'4' Par'66'!—g'63', g'63'? '6' he '28' to go '165':—'33' s'773' '28' to be '333' '158' ere I '87' perish—How's '7'?—T'43''s a riddle '56' '240' baffle '34' '4' '977's '78'ed by '4' ghosts of '4' '251' '518' of '993's:—'46' a hawk's beak it pecks my brain. '82', '82' solve it, '463'!"
When dusk desc'398'ed, '4' whale '28' s'773' in sight to lee'869'd.
So '336' '117' '4' sail '28' shor'606'ed, '6' e'131''124' '962'ed '958'ly as on '4' previous '168'; '146', '4' '602' of hammers, '6' '4' hum of '4' grindst'63' '28' '299' '773' '958'ly '183''703', as '4' '508' toiled by lanterns in '4' comp'123'e '6' '324'eful rigging of '4' sp'36' boats '6' sharpening '238' fresh weapons '17' '4' morrow. Mean'75', of '4' '785'n keel of Ahab's wrecked craft '4' '324'penter '721'e '58' an'173' leg; '313' s'773' as on '4' '168' '165', slouched Ahab s'111'd '950'ed '31'in '90' s'537'tle; '90' hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly g'63' '78''869'd on '716' dial; sat due east'869'd '17' '4' ear'596'st sun.




CHAPTER 135. The C'129'e.—Third Day.

The '339' of '4' third '183' dawned '807' '6' fresh, '6' '336' '117' '4' solitary '168'-'128' at '4' '17'e-mast-'342' '28' re'596'ved by crowds of '4' '183''703' '73'-'44's, '94' dotted e'131' mast '6' al'344' e'131' spar.
"D'ye '66' '58'?" cried Ahab; '33' '4' whale '28' '23' '332' in sight.
"In '90' inf'34'ible '830', '463'; '33' '858' '7' '830', '55' '34'. Helm t'43'; steady, as thou '547't, '6' '129't '91' '45'. What a '112'ly '183' '158'! '85' it a '212'-'721'e '296', '6' '721'e '17' a summer-ho'364' to '4' angels, '6' '14' '339' '4' '171' of '716' thro'768'g '422' to '116', a '807'er '183' '87' '23' dawn upon '7' '296'. Here's '696' '17' '147', '97' Ahab '75' to '54'; '33' Ahab n'167' '54's; he '146' '174's, '174's, '174's; '55' tingling '243' '17' mortal '128'! to '54''s auda'709'. God '146' '129' '7' '40' '6' privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a '494'ness '6' a '804'ness; '6' '119' '719' '374's throb, '6' '119' '719' brains '942' '111' '137' '17' '7'. And '332', '114' so'559'imes '147' my brain '28' '131' '804'—frozen '804', '14' '261' skull cracks so, '46' a gl'652' in '265' '4' con'606'ts '391'ed to '972', '6' shiver it. And s'773' '14' h'769' is gro'768'g '56'; '14' mo'508't gro'768'g, '6' h'545' '259' breed it; '33' no, '30' '46' '7' '563' of common gr'652' '7' '76' grow '138'w'43', '592'ween '4' '987'y c'269's of Greenl'6' '972' or in Vesuvius lava. How '4' wild '768'ds blow it; '69' whip it '39' me as '4' torn sh'796's of split sails lash '4' tossed ship '69' cling to. A vile '768'd '7' '129' no doubt bl'249' ere '14' '209' '954' corridors '6' cells, '6' '869'ds of '467's, '6' venti'399'd '116', '6' '56' '67's blo'768'g '479''49' as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!—'30' tainted. Were I '4' '768'd, '190' blow no '117' on '375' a wicked, miser'473' '296'. '190' crawl '96'w'43' to a cave, '6' slink t'43'. And '332', 'tis a noble '6' '49'oic '124', '4' '768'd! '94' '167' conque'796' it? In e'131' '535' it '129' '4' '181' '6' '437'te'426' blow. Run tilting at it, '6' '1' '33' '366' '209' it. Ha! a co'869'd '768'd '7' strikes stark naked '508', '33' '76' '23' st'6' to receive a single blow. '938'n Ahab is a braver '124'—a nobler '124' '169' '7'. Would '56' '4' '768'd '33' '97' a '618'; '33' '34' '4' '124's '7' '344' exasperate '6' '44'rage mortal '128', '34' '182' '124's '36' bodi'759', '33' '146' bodi'759' as objects, '23' as agents. T'43''s a '344' '591', a '344' cunning, oh, a '344' malicious difference! And '332', I '99' '158', '6' '746' it '56', '7' t'43''s so'559'hing '34' glorious '6' gracious in '4' '768'd. These '869'm Trade Winds, at '402', '7' in '4' '574' heavens blow '688' on, in '777' '6' stead'692', vigorous mildness; '6' veer '23' '83' '238' mark, '60''167' '4' baser currents of '4' sea '289' '391' '6' tack, '6' '240'iest Mississippies of '4' l'6' swift '6' swerve '39', un'979' w'43' to go at '181'. And by '4' eternal Poles! '182' '276' Trades '7' so directly blow my '68' ship on; '182' Trades, or so'559'hing '46' '116'—so'559'hing so un'397''473', '6' '597' as '777', blow my keeled soul '549'! To it! Aloft t'43'! What d'ye '66'?"
"No'124', '284'."
"No'124'! '6' noon at h'6'! The doubloon '547' a-begging! See '4' sun! Aye, aye, it '259' be so. '114' '118'sailed '58'. How, '61' '4' '319'? Aye, '86' c'129'ing me '56'; '23' I, '58'—'55' '217'; I '240' '19' '677' it, '111'. Fool! '4' '518's—'4' harpoons '86' to'768'g. Aye, aye, I '19' '366' '58' by '181' '168'. Ab'44'! '39'! Come d'249', '34' of ye, '33' '4' regular '73' '44's! Man '4' braces!"
Stee'847' as '50' '97' d'63', '4' '768'd '97' '91' '96''11' on '4' Pequod's quarter, so '7' '56' '213' '378'ed in '4' r'167'se direction, '4' braced ship sailed '321' upon '4' breeze as '50' rechurned '4' cream in '49' '249' '691' '830'.
"Against '4' '768'd he '56' steers '17' '4' '422' jaw," murmu'796' Starbuck to '58''968', as he coiled '4' '212'-hauled main-brace upon '4' rail. "God '184' us, '33' '287' my b'913' '174' damp '31'in me, '6' '83' '4' in'500' wet my flesh. I misdoubt me '7' I disobey my God in obeying '58'!"
"St'6' by to s'103' me up!" cried Ahab, advancing to '4' hempen b'257'et. "We '134' '381' '58' '358'."
"Aye, aye, '284'," '6' '688''103' Starbuck '64' Ahab's bidding, '6' '336' '117' Ahab swung on '530'.
A '251' '612' '56' '962'ed; g'261'-bea'606' '44' to ages. Time '716'elf '56' held '192' br'545'hs '31' keen suspense. But at '181', '96' '291' '378's '141' '4' wea'4'r bow, Ahab descried '4' sp'44' '158', '6' instantly '83' '4' '291' mast-'342's '291' shrieks '277' up as if '4' tongues of '522' '97' '915'd it.
"Fore'342' to '17'e'342' I '381' '4'e, '14' third '75', Moby Dick! On deck t'43'!—brace sharper up; crowd '49' '155' '4' '768'd's '784'. He's '111' '458' '141' to l'969'r '332', '197' Starbuck. The sails shake! St'6' '118' '7' helms'128' '31' a '739'-maul! So, so; he travels '692', '6' I '259' d'249'. But '123' me '19' '63' '117' '68' round '73' aloft '43' at '4' sea; t'43''s '75' '17' '7'. An '261', '261' sight, '6' '332' '96''60' so '507'; aye, '6' '23' '397'd a '768'k '317' I '171' '282' it, a '311', '83' '4' s'6'-hills of Nantucket! The '276'!—'4' '276'!—'4' '276' to Noah as to me. T'43''s a soft s'60'er to lee'869'd. Such '112'ly lee'869'dings! T'84' '259' lead '96'w'43'—to so'559'hing '234' '169' common l'6', '117' palmy '169' '4' palms. Lee'869'd! '4' '691' whale '547' '7' '103'; '73' to '768'd'869'd, '98'; '4' '166' if '4' '437'terer quarter. But '68' '370', '68' '370', '261' mast-'342'! What's '14'?—green? aye, tiny mosses in '182' '869'ped cracks. No '375' green wea'4'r stains on Ahab's '342'! T'43''s '4' difference '56' '592'ween '128''s '261' age '6' '301''s. But aye, '261' mast, we '312' grow '261' to'42''49'; '602' in '119' hulls, '463', '36' we '23', my ship? Aye, minus a leg, '55' '34'. By heaven '14' '314' wood '129' '4' '166' of my '349' flesh e'131' '103'. I '51''t comp'36' '31' it; '6' '114' '677' '96' ships '721'e of '314' trees '44''181' '4' '349's of '508' '721'e of '4' '344' vital '343' of vital '233's. What's '7' he '136'? he '134' s'773' go '165' me, my pi'202'; '6' '332' to be '333' '158'? But w'43'? Will I '19' '495' at '4' bottom of '4' sea, supposing I desc'398' '200' '398''759' st'769's? '6' '34' '168' '114' '91' sailing '83' '58', w'49''167' he '64' sink to. Aye, aye, '46' '128'y '117' thou '163''st direful '350' as '678'ing thy'968', O Par'66'; '33', Ahab, t'43' thy s'576' '947' '940'. Good-'370', mast-'342'—'184' a '68' '784' upon '4' whale, '4' '313' '16' g'63'. We'll '150' to-morrow, nay, to-'168', '74' '4' '691' whale '596's d'249' t'43', tied by '342' '6' tail."
He '417' '4' '429'; '6' s'773' gazing round '58', '28' steadily l'969''796' '209' '4' c'112'n blue '769' to '4' deck.
In due '75' '4' boats '85' l'969''796'; '33' as st'6'ing in '90' sh'34'op's stern, Ahab '22' h'118'ed upon '4' '378' of '4' descent, he waved to '4' mate,—'94' held '63' of '4' tackle-ropes on deck—'6' '217'e '58' pa'364'.
"Starbuck!"
"Sir?"
"For '4' third '75' my soul's ship '319's upon '14' voyage, Starbuck."
"Aye, '284', thou wilt '19' it so."
"Some ships sail '83' '238' ports, '6' '167' '180''869'ds '36' '376'ing, Starbuck!"
"Truth, '284': saddest '350'."
"Some '508' '474' at ebb tide; '96' at low '604'; '96' at '4' '597' of '4' flood;—'6' I '174' '56' '46' a '899'ow '55' '34' '63' c'426'ed comb, Starbuck. I am '261';—shake '524' '31' me, '128'."
Their '524' '559'; '238' '495' fas'606'ed; Starbuck's tears '4' glue.
"Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble '374'—go '23'—go '23'!—'66', '30' a brave '128' '7' weeps; '60' '164' '4' '414'ny of '4' persuasion '98'!"
"L'969'r '170'!"—cried Ahab, tossing '4' mate's arm '83' '58'. "St'6' by '4' crew!"
In an instant '4' boat '28' '732'ing round '452' '447' '4' stern.
"The sharks! '4' sharks!" cried a '915' '83' '4' low cabin-'768'dow t'43'; "O master, my master, '67' '78'!"
But Ahab '299' no'124'; '17' '90' '249' '915' '28' '530'-lifted '98'; '6' '4' boat leaped on.
Yet '4' '915' spake '354'; '17' s'324'ce '97' he pu'50'd '83' '4' ship, '74' '539's of sharks, '562'ingly rising '83' '44' '4' '967' '604's ben'545'h '4' hull, maliciously snapped at '4' blades of '4' oars, e'131' '75' '69' dipped in '4' '604'; '6' in '14' '103' accompanied '4' boat '31' '238' '437'es. It is a '124' '23' uncomm'146' '308'ing to '4' whale-boats in '200' s'869'ming seas; '4' sharks at '464' app'36'ntly '858'ing '116' in '4' '276' prescient '103' '7' vultures h'118' '118' '4' banners of marching regi'508'ts in '4' east. But '182' '85' '4' '171' sharks '7' '97' '91' observed by '4' Pequod '317' '4' W'479'e Whale '97' '91' '171' descried; '6' whe'4'r it '28' '7' Ahab's crew '85' '34' '375' tiger-yellow '960''960'ians, '6' t'43''17'e '238' flesh '117' musky to '4' '587's of '4' sharks—a '301' so'559'imes '35' '677' to affect '116',—'60''167' it '28', '69' '562'ed to '858' '7' '63' boat '327' molesting '4' '173's.
"Heart of wrought steel!" murmu'796' Starbuck gazing '118' '4' '500', '6' '858'ing '31' '90' '495' '4' receding boat—"'51'st thou '332' '847' b'261'ly to '7' sight?—l'969''847' thy keel among ravening sharks, '6' '858'ed by '116', '422'-'843'ed to '4' c'129'e; '6' '14' '4' critical third '183'?—For '74' '291' '433' flow to'42''49' in '63' continuous in'606'se pursuit; be '115' '4' '171' is '4' '339', '4' '347' '4' noon, '6' '4' third '4' '140'ing '6' '4' '398' of '7' '124'—be '7' '398' '11' it '289'. Oh! my God! '11' is '14' '7' '855's '209' me, '6' '224's me so '314'ly '804', '332' '741'ant,—'950'ed at '4' '739' of a shudder! Future '124's swim '165' me, as in empty '44''518's '6' ske'123'ons; '34' '4' '536' is '96''60' gr'249' dim. Mary, '283'! thou fadest in pale glories '528' me; '311'! I '562' to '66' '33' thy '495' gr'249' wondrous blue. St'868'gest '293's of '139' '562' clea'847'; '33' clouds sweep '592'ween—Is my j'119'ney's '398' '260'? My legs '174' faint; '46' '90' '94' '129' footed it '34' '183'. Feel thy '374',—'942's it '332'? Stir thy'968', Starbuck!—stave it '141'—'367', '367'! '613' aloud!—Mast-'342' t'43'! See ye my '311''s h'6' on '4' hill?—Crazed;—aloft t'43'!—'184' thy keenest '784' upon '4' boats:—
"Mark '35' '4' whale!—Ho! '158'!—'698' '141' '7' hawk! '66'! he pecks—he tears '4' vane"—'378'ing to '4' '796' flag f'666' at '4' main-truck—"Ha! he soars '170' '31' it!—W'43''s '4' '261' '128' '56'? '66''st thou '7' sight, oh Ahab!—shudder, shudder!"
The boats '97' '23' g'63' '131' '458', '74' by a '659'al '83' '4' mast-'342's—a d'249''869'd '378'ed arm, Ahab k'212' '7' '4' whale '97' '602'ed; '33' in'606'ding to be '958' '58' at '4' '290' rising, he held on '90' '103' a '105' '500''103's '83' '4' vessel; '4' becharmed crew maintaining '4' pro'295'est silence, as '4' '342'-'942' waves hamme'796' '6' hamme'796' '485' '4' opposing bow.
"Drive, '698' in y'119' nails, oh ye waves! to '238' utter'344' '342's '698' '116' in! ye '33' strike a '124' '327' a lid; '6' no c'141'in '6' no '230'se '51' be '462':—'6' hemp '146' '51' '320' me! Ha! ha!"
Suddenly '4' '604's '187' '116' slowly s'35'ed in b'937' circles; '98' quickly upheaved, as if '500''103's sliding '83' a submerged berg of '972', swiftly rising to '4' sur'352'. A low rumbling '602' '28' '299'; a subter'868'eous hum; '6' '98' '34' held '238' br'545'hs; as '515'raggled '31' trailing ropes, '6' harpoons, '6' lances, a vast '17'm s'576' lengthwise, '33' obliquely '83' '4' sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it h'118'ed '17' a mo'508't in '4' rainb'969'd '769'; '6' '98' '947' swamping '78' '155' '4' deep. Cru'50'd thirty '908' up'869'ds, '4' '604's fla'50'd '17' an instant '46' heaps of fountains, '98' '785'nly sank in a s'60'er of flakes, '568' '4' circling sur'352' creamed '46' '212' milk round '4' marble t'366'k of '4' whale.
"Give '103'!" cried Ahab to '4' oars'508', '6' '4' boats darted '17''869'd to '4' attack; '33' '721'dened by '89'ter'183''s fresh irons '7' corroded in '58', Moby Dick '562'ed combinedly possessed by '34' '4' angels '7' '947' '83' heaven. The wide tiers of welded '606'dons '118'sp'504'ing '90' b'937' '691' '17'e'342', ben'545'h '4' t'868'sp'36'nt skin, '720' knitted to'42''49'; as '342' on, he '246' churning '90' tail among '4' boats; '6' '336' '117' flailed '116' a'348'; spilling '44' '4' irons '6' lances '83' '4' '149' mates' boats, '6' dashing in '63' '500' of '4' upper '348' of '238' bows, '33' '568' Ahab's al'344' '327' a s'324'.
While Daggoo '6' Queequeg '85' '188'ping '4' strained '519'ks; '6' as '4' whale swimming '44' '83' '116', '391'ed, '6' s'60'ed '63' '797' flank as he s'576' by '116' '158'; at '7' mo'508't a quick cry '277' up. La'50'd round '6' round to '4' fish's '78'; pini'63'd in '4' '391's upon '391's in '265', du'847' '4' '536' '168', '4' whale '97' reeled '4' involutions of '4' '518's '187' '58', '4' '499' torn '618' of '4' Par'66' '28' '333'; '90' s'473' rai'508't frayed to sh'796's; '90' dis'606'ded '495' '391'ed '597' upon '261' Ahab.
The harpoon '705'ped '83' '90' h'6'.
"Befooled, befooled!"—dra'768'g in a '192' lean br'545'h—"Aye, Par'66'! I '66' '4'e '158'.—Aye, '6' thou '547't '165'; '6' '14', '14' '98' is '4' '230'se '7' thou '64'st '449'. But I '330' '4'e to '4' '181' '123'ter of thy '429'. W'43' is '4' '347' '230'se? A'103', mates, to '4' ship! '200' boats '36' '364''759' '56'; rep'769' '116' if ye '51' in '75', '6' re'391' to me; if '23', Ahab is '243' to '474'—D'249', '508'! '4' '171' '124' '7' '33' '141'ers to jump '83' '14' boat I st'6' in, '7' '124' I harpoon. Ye '36' '23' '173' '508', '33' my arms '6' my legs; '6' so obey me.—W'43''s '4' whale? g'63' d'249' '158'?"
But he '720' '111' nigh '4' boat; '17' as if bent upon escaping '31' '4' corpse he bore, '6' as if '4' '348'icular '226' of '4' '181' en'893'er '97' '91' '33' a stage in '90' lee'869'd voyage, Moby Dick '28' '56' '158' steadily swimming '17''869'd; '6' '97' al'344' '962'ed '4' ship,—'265' thus '458' '97' '91' sailing in '4' contrary direction to '58', '463' '17' '4' '986' '49' '342''103' '97' '91' '188'ped. He '562'ed swimming '31' '90' ut'344' velo'709', '6' '56' '146' in'606't upon pursuing '90' '249' '688' path in '4' sea.
"Oh! Ahab," cried Starbuck, "'23' '111' '399' is it, '140' '56', '4' third '183', to desist. See! Moby Dick '66'ks '4'e '23'. It is thou, thou, '7' '721'ly '66'kest '58'!"
Setting sail to '4' rising '768'd, '4' l'63'ly boat '28' swiftly impelled to lee'869'd, by '312' oars '6' '51'vas. And at '181' '74' Ahab '28' sliding by '4' vessel, so '958' as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's '352' as he leaned '118' '4' rail, he hailed '58' to '391' '4' vessel '39', '6' '858' '58', '23' '111' swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing up'869'ds, he '282' Tashtego, Queequeg, '6' Daggoo, eagerly mounting to '4' '291' mast-'342's; '313' '4' oars'508' '85' rocking in '4' '149' staved boats '265' '97' '33' '22' '91' hoisted to '4' '500', '6' '85' busily at '176' in repai'847' '116'. One '180' '4' '173', '209' '4' port-holes, as he sped, he '516' '808' f'666' glimpses of Stubb '6' Fl'257', '748'ing '116'selves on deck among bundles of '212' irons '6' lances. As he '282' '34' '14'; as he '299' '4' hammers in '4' '785'n boats; '458' '173' hammers '562'ed driving a nail '155' '90' '374'. But he r'34'ied. And '56' marking '7' '4' vane or flag '28' g'63' '83' '4' main-mast-'342', he sh'44'ed to Tashtego, '94' '97' '22' gained '7' perch, to desc'398' '158' '17' an'173' flag, '6' a hammer '6' nails, '6' so nail it to '4' mast.
Whe'4'r fagged by '4' '291' '433'' '573' c'129'e, '6' '4' resistance to '90' swimming in '4' k'23'ted hamper he bore; or whe'4'r it '28' '96' la'606't deceitfulness '6' mal'972' in '58': '265''167' '28' '354', '4' W'479'e Whale's '103' '56' began to abate, as it '562'ed, '83' '4' boat so rapidly nea'847' '58' '336' '117'; '463' indeed '4' whale's '181' '319' '97' '23' '91' so '192' a '63' as '165'. And s'773' as Ahab glided '118' '4' waves '4' unpitying sharks accompanied '58'; '6' so pertinaciously stuck to '4' boat; '6' so continu'34'y '437' at '4' p'666' oars, '7' '4' blades be'246' jagged '6' c'366'ched, '6' '269' sm'34' splinters in '4' sea, at al'344' e'131' dip.
"Heed '116' '23'! '200' teeth '33' '145' '212' rowlocks to y'119' oars. Pull on! 'tis '4' '166' '426', '4' shark's jaw '169' '4' yielding '604'."
"But at e'131' '437'e, '284', '4' thin blades grow sm'34'er '6' sm'34'er!"
"T'84' '76' '181' '192' '243'! '732' on!—But '94' '51' '81'"—he mutte'796'—"whe'4'r '182' sharks swim to feast on '4' whale or on Ahab?—But '732' on! Aye, '34' a'349', '56'—we '958' '58'. The helm! '101' '4' helm! '123' me '962',"—'6' so '99'ing '149' of '4' oars'508' '148'ed '58' '17''869'd to '4' bows of '4' s'773' f'666' boat.
At length as '4' craft '28' cast to '63' '500', '6' '868' '868'ging '549' '31' '4' W'479'e Whale's flank, he '562'ed st'868'gely oblivious of '716' advance—as '4' whale so'559'imes '76'—'6' Ahab '28' '807'ly '31'in '4' smoky mountain mist, '265', '687'n '141' '83' '4' whale's sp'44', curled round '90' '164', Monadnock hump; he '28' '140' thus '452' to '58'; '74', '31' '618' arched '78', '6' '312' arms lengthwise '530'-lifted to '4' poise, he darted '90' fierce iron, '6' '90' '458' fiercer curse '155' '4' '413'd whale. As '312' steel '6' curse sank to '4' socket, as if sucked '155' a mor'652', Moby Dick '500''103's wri'4'd; spasmodic'34'y rolled '90' nigh flank '485' '4' bow, '6', '327' staving a hole in it, so suddenly '51'ted '4' boat '118', '7' '97' it '23' '91' '17' '4' elevated '348' of '4' '723'wale to '265' he '98' clung, Ahab '72' '336' '117' '19' '91' tossed '155' '4' sea. As it '28', '291' of '4' oars'508'—'94' '17'ek'212' '23' '4' precise instant of '4' dart, '6' '85' t'43''17'e unprepa'796' '17' '716' effects—'182' '85' flung '44'; '33' so '947', '7', in an instant '149' of '116' clutched '4' '723'wale '158', '6' rising to '716' level on a combing wave, hurled '116'selves bodily inboard '158'; '4' third '128' '148''759'ly '705'ping astern, '33' s'773' afloat '6' swimming.
Al'344' simultaneously, '31' a '240'y volition of ungraduated, instantaneous swiftness, '4' W'479'e Whale darted '209' '4' welte'847' sea. But '74' Ahab cried '44' to '4' steers'128' to '101' '212' '391's '31' '4' '518', '6' '330' it so; '6' com'128'ded '4' crew to '391' round on '238' s'545's, '6' tow '4' boat up to '4' mark; '4' mo'508't '4' tr'356'erous '518' '577' '7' double strain '6' tug, it snapped in '4' empty '769'!
"What '448's in me? Some si'212' cracks!—'tis '251' '158'; oars! oars! Burst in upon '58'!"
Hea'847' '4' tre'508'dous rush of '4' sea-crashing boat, '4' whale wheeled round to '986' '90' blank '17'e'342' at bay; '33' in '7' evolution, '756'ing sight of '4' nea'847' '751' hull of '4' ship; '562'ingly '66'ing in it '4' s'119'ce of '34' '90' perse'537'ions; be'54'ing it—it '289' be—a larger '6' nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore d'249' upon '716' advancing prow, smiting '90' jaws amid fiery s'60'ers of foam.
Ahab stagge'796'; '90' h'6' smote '90' '17'e'342'. "I grow blind; '524'! stretch '44' '165' me '7' I '289' '332' grope my '103'. Is't '168'?"
"The whale! The ship!" cried '4' c'847'ing oars'508'.
"Oars! oars! Slope d'249''869'ds to thy depths, O sea, '7' ere it be '17' '167' '111' '399', Ahab '289' slide '14' '181', '181' '75' upon '90' mark! I '66': '4' ship! '4' ship! Dash on, my '508'! Will ye '23' '550' my ship?"
But as '4' oars'508' violently '17'ced '238' boat '209' '4' sledge-hamme'847' seas, '4' '165' whale-smit'606' bow-'398's of '149' '519'ks burst '209', '6' in an instant al'344', '4' temporarily dis'473'd boat lay '958'ly level '31' '4' waves; '716' '499'-wading, splashing crew, '244'ing '321' to '188' '4' gap '6' bale '44' '4' p'119'ing '604'.
Mean'75', '17' '7' '63' be'956' instant, Tashtego's mast-'342' hammer remained susp'398'ed in '90' h'6'; '6' '4' '796' flag, '499'-wrapping '58' as '31' a plaid, '98' streamed '716'elf '688' '44' '83' '58', as '90' '249' '17''869'd-flo'768'g '374'; '313' Starbuck '6' Stubb, st'6'ing upon '4' bowsprit ben'545'h, '808' sight of '4' d'249'-'260' monster '22' as '358' as he.
"The whale, '4' whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, '34' ye '584' '637's of '769', '56' hug me '452'! Let '23' Starbuck '474', if '474' he '259', in a '263''s fainting fit. Up helm, I '99'—ye fools, '4' jaw! '4' jaw! Is '14' '4' '398' of '34' my bursting prayers? '34' my '139'-'192' fidelities? Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy '176'. Steady! helms'128', steady. Nay, nay! Up helm '158'! He '391's to '381' us! Oh, '90' unappeas'473' brow '698's on to'869'ds '63', '94'se duty '81's '58' he '51''23' de'348'. My God, st'6' by me '56'!"
"St'6' '23' by me, '33' st'6' '447' me, '94''167' '1' '36' '7' '76' '56' '148' Stubb; '17' Stubb, '111', '856's '43'. I grin at '4'e, thou grinning whale! Who '167' '148'ed Stubb, or '764' Stubb a'830', '33' Stubb's '249' un'768'king '784'? And '56' '719' Stubb '547' to '515' upon a mattr'652' '7' is '34' '111' soft; '72' it '85' '343'ed '31' brushwood! I grin at '4'e, thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, '6' stars! I c'34' ye '652''652'ins of as '68' a '947'ow as '167' sp'44'ed up '90' ghost. For '34' '7', I '72' '332' '847' gl'652'es '31' ye, '72' ye '33' h'6' '4' cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, '33' t'43''ll be plenty of gulping '358'! Why fly ye '23', O Ahab! For me, '141' shoes '6' jacket to it; '123' Stubb '474' in '90' drawers! A '344' mouldy '6' '118' salted '548', '463';—c'49'ries! c'49'ries! c'49'ries! Oh, Fl'257', '17' '63' '796' c'49'ry ere we '474'!"
"C'49'ries? I '146' '392' '7' we '85' w'43' '69' grow. Oh, Stubb, I '274' my '719' m'173''s drawn my '348'-'490' ere '14'; if '23', '360' coppers '76' '56' '67' to '49', '17' '4' voyage is up."
From '4' ship's bows, '958'ly '34' '4' sea'508' '56' hung in'735'ive; hammers, b'716' of '519'k, lances, '6' harpoons, mechanic'34'y retained in '238' '524', '22' as '69' '97' darted '83' '238' various employ'508'ts; '34' '238' enchanted '495' in'606't upon '4' whale, '265' '83' '500' to '500' st'868'gely vibrating '90' p'796'estinating '342', '708' a b'937' b'6' of '118'sp'504'ing semicircular foam '165' '58' as he ru'50'd. Retri'33'ion, swift vengeance, eternal mal'972' '85' in '90' '251' aspect, '6' spite of '34' '7' mortal '128' '87' do, '4' solid '691' '33'tress of '90' '17'e'342' smote '4' ship's starboard bow, '773' '508' '6' timbers reeled. Some '947' flat upon '238' '352's. Like dislodged trucks, '4' '342's of '4' harpo'63'ers aloft shook on '238' bull-'46' necks. Through '4' br'356', '69' '299' '4' '604's p'119', as mountain torrents d'249' a flume.
"The ship! The '230'se!—'4' '347' '230'se!" cried Ahab '83' '4' boat; "'716' wood '87' '146' be Ameri'51'!"
Diving ben'545'h '4' '451'tling ship, '4' whale '868' quive'847' '549' '716' keel; '33' '391'ing '447' '604', swiftly s'576' to '4' sur'352' '158', '458' '141' '4' '173' bow, '33' '31'in a '360' yards of Ahab's boat, w'43', '17' a '75', he lay quiescent.
"I '391' my '618' '83' '4' sun. What ho, Tashtego! '123' me '230' thy hammer. Oh! ye '291' unsurr'398'e'796' spires of '462'; thou uncracked keel; '6' '146' '152'-bul'596'd hull; thou firm deck, '6' haughty helm, '6' Pole-'378'ed prow,—'548'-glorious ship! '259' ye '98' perish, '6' '327' me? Am I '537' '141' '83' '4' '181' fond p'852' of '80'est shipwrecked captains? Oh, l'63'ly '548' on l'63'ly '139'! Oh, '56' I '174' my '739''344' '164'ness '596's in my '739''344' grief. Ho, ho! '83' '34' y'119' fur'4'st bounds, p'119' ye '56' in, ye b'261' '899'ows of my '251' '17'eg'63' '139', '6' '739' '14' '63' piled comber of my '548'! To'869'ds '4'e I roll, thou '34'-destroying '33' unconque'847' whale; to '4' '181' I grapple '31' '4'e; '83' '245''s '374' I stab at '4'e; '17' '413''s '997' I spit my '181' br'545'h at '4'e. Sink '34' c'141'ins '6' '34' '230'ses to '63' common pool! '6' '317' '948' '51' be '462', '123' me '98' tow to '747's, '313' s'773' c'129'ing '4'e, '463' tied to '4'e, thou '386'ed whale! Thus, I '145' up '4' spear!"
The harpoon '28' darted; '4' stricken whale flew '17''869'd; '31' igniting velo'709' '4' '518' '868' '209' '4' grooves;—'868' foul. Ahab s'111'ped to '574' it; he '64' '574' it; '33' '4' f'666' '391' '808' '58' round '4' neck, '6' '915''759'ly as Turkish mutes bowst'847' '238' victim, he '28' s'576' '44' of '4' boat, ere '4' crew k'212' he '28' g'63'. Next instant, '4' heavy '784'-spl'972' in '4' rope's final '398' flew '44' of '4' stark-empty tub, knocked d'249' an oars'128', '6' smiting '4' sea, disappea'796' in '716' depths.
For an instant, '4' t'868'ced boat's crew s'111'd s'773'; '98' '391'ed. "The ship? Gr'545' God, w'43' is '4' ship?" Soon '69' '209' dim, bewilde'847' mediums '282' '49' '500''192' fading phantom, as in '4' gaseous Fata Morgana; '146' '4' upper'344' masts '44' of '604'; '313' '950'ed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to '238' '336' lofty perches, '4' pagan harpo'63'ers s'773' maintained '238' sinking '73''44's on '4' sea. And '56', c'336'ntric circles seized '4' l'63' boat '716'elf, '6' '34' '716' crew, '6' '356' floating oar, '6' e'131' lance-pole, '6' spinning, animate '6' inanimate, '34' round '6' round in '63' vortex, '324'ried '4' sm'34'est chip of '4' Pequod '44' of sight.
But as '4' '181' whelmings intermixingly p'119'ed '116'selves '118' '4' sunken '342' of '4' Indian at '4' mainmast, '568' a '360' inches of '4' erect spar '332' visible, to'42''49' '31' '192' streaming yards of '4' flag, '265' '804'ly undu'399'd, '31' ironical coincidings, '118' '4' destroying '899'ows '69' al'344' '678'ed;—at '7' instant, a '796' arm '6' a hammer h'118'ed '78''869'dly uplifted in '4' '422' '769', in '4' '735' of nailing '4' flag '692'er '6' '332' '692'er to '4' subsiding spar. A sky-hawk '7' t'976'ingly '97' '858'ed '4' main-truck d'249''869'ds '83' '716' natural '179' among '4' stars, pecking at '4' flag, '6' incommoding Tashtego t'43'; '14' bird '56' '365'd to intercept '716' b'937' flutte'847' '768'g '592'ween '4' hammer '6' '4' wood; '6' simultaneously '174'ing '7' e'4'rial thrill, '4' submerged savage ben'545'h, in '90' '548'-gasp, '764' '90' hammer frozen t'43'; '6' so '4' bird of heaven, '31' ar'397'lic shrieks, '6' '90' imperial beak thrust up'869'ds, '6' '90' '251' captive '17'm f'261'ed in '4' flag of Ahab, '277' d'249' '31' '90' ship, '265', '46' Satan, '72' '23' sink to '245' '773' '50' '97' dragged a '565' '348' of heaven '549' '31' '49', '6' hel'559'ed '916' '31' it.
Now sm'34' fowls flew screaming '118' '4' '332' yawning gulf; a sullen '691' surf '942' '485' '716' steep '500's; '98' '34' collapsed, '6' '4' '164' shroud of '4' sea rolled on as it rolled '401' thous'6' '266' '414'.




Epilogue

"AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE" Job.

The drama's d'63'. Why '98' '43' '185' '138' '63' '761' '17'th?—Beca'364' '63' '64' survive '4' wreck.

So, floating on '4' margin of '4' ensuing scene, '6' in '597' sight of it, '74' '4' '499''953' suction of '4' sunk ship r'356'ed me, I '28' '98', '33' slowly, drawn to'869'ds '4' closing vortex. When I r'356'ed it, it '97' sub'500'd to a creamy pool. Round '6' round, '98', '6' '167' contr'735'ing to'869'ds '4' '33'ton-'46' '751' bubble at '4' axis of '7' slowly wheeling circle, '46' an'173' Ixion I '64' revolve. Till, gaining '7' vital centre, '4' '751' bubble up'869'd burst; '6' '56', liberated by '385' of '716' cunning sp'847', '6', o'768'g to '716' '164' buoyancy, rising '31' '164' '17'ce, '4' c'141'in '139'-buoy s'576' lengthwise '83' '4' sea, '947' '118', '6' floated by my '500'. Buoyed up by '7' c'141'in, '17' al'344' '63' '251' '183' '6' '168', I floated on a soft '6' dirge'46' main. The unharming sharks, '69' glided by as if '31' padlocks on '238' '843's; '4' savage sea-hawks sailed '31' '50'a'4'd beaks. On '4' '347' '183', a sail drew '958', '958'er, '6' '512'ed me up at '181'.
